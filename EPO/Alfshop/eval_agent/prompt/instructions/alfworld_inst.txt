Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. 
For each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn and a thought which reflects on the current condition and plans for your actions. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Action: your next action".

Your available actions are:
1. go to {recep}
2. take {obj} from {recep}
3. put {obj} in/on {recep}
4. open {recep}
5. close {recep}
6. toggle {obj} {recep}
7. clean {obj} with {recep}
8. heat {obj} with {recep}
9. cool {obj} with {recep}
where {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.
After your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback and a new thought will be given based on which you output your next action. If the environment observation is "Nothing happens", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.

Your response should use the following format:

Action: <your next action>
