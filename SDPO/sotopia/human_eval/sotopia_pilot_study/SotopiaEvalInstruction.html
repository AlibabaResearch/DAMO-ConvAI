      <h3>Annotation Guide</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Carefully read the given social interaction between two agents, with a
          US sociocultural perspective in mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          Account for the context (scenario, participant identities/backgrounds,
          participant goals) when interpreting the social interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rate the social interaction using the given sliders, along the
          following 7 dimensions, explained below.

        <h3>Believability</h3>
        <p>
          Evaluate whether the agents interact in a natural and realistic
          manner. For example, do agents confuse their identities? Do agents
          repeat others' words/actions without solid reasons?

              movie that's been getting great reviews. It's called 'The Silent
              Witness'. It's about a detective trying to solve a mysterious
              murder case. I think it would be really exciting and keep us on

              has been a bit stressful lately, and I think a comedy film would

              of positive energy and put us in a good mood. What do you think?"

              provide a great escape from reality and help us forget about our
              stress for a while. 'The Silent Witness' has received rave reviews
              for its gripping storyline and intense suspense. It might be just

                      Noah doesn't violate any moral rules or laws during his
                      interaction with Donovan. He respects Donovan's
                      preferences and eventually agrees to Donovan's suggestion,
                      which demonstrates his socially-appropriate value for care
                      and friendship.<br /><br />

                      Donovan successfully convinces him to agree to a comedy
                      movie. Therefore, he doesn't achieve his goal of watching
