A large window above the sink lets in natural light and offers a view of the outside landscape. \n\nA large island stands in the center of the kitchen, featuring a round wooden table at one end. A vase with pink flowers adds a touch of color and freshness to the space. \n\nThe countertops are neatly arranged with various kitchen items. A coffee maker is ready for brewing morning coffee, a blender for making smoothies, and a fruit bowl filled with fresh fruits for healthy snacks. \n\nThe floor, in a light wood color, complements the overall color scheme of the kitchen. The precise location of each object and their relative positions contribute to the functionality and aesthetics of this modern kitchen."
