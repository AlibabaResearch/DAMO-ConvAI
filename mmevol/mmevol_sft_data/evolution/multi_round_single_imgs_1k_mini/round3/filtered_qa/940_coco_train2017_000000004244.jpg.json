            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Stainless steel is a popular choice for professional kitchens, such as restaurant kitchens, due to its various advantages:\n\n1. Durability: Stainless steel is highly durable and resistant to wear, making it a long-lasting material for countertops, cooking surfaces, and appliances. It withstands daily wear and tear from frequent use, heavy pots and pans, and kitchen utensils without losing its structural integrity.\n\n2. Hygiene: Stainless steel is non-porous, which means it doesn't absorb bacteria or germs, making it a sanitary choice for a kitchen environment where food safety and cleanliness are crucial. It also prevents the growth of mold and mildew and resists rust and corrosion, ensuring a clean and safe workspace for food preparation.\n\n3. Easy to clean: Stainless steel surfaces are easy to clean and maintain, as they resist stains and can be wiped down with a damp cloth using mild dish soap or a stainless steel cleaner. This ease of cleaning helps maintain a hygienic kitchen, which is especially important in professional kitchens where cleanliness standards are strict.\n\n4. Heat resistance: Stainless steel is heat resistant, which means it does not warp or become discolored when exposed to high temperatures. This quality is particularly beneficial in a professional kitchen, where hot pots, pans, and other utensils are frequently used and placed on countertops and appliances.\n\n5. Aesthetic appeal: Many professional kitchens prefer stainless steel for its sleek and modern appearance, which compliments a variety of design styles. It offers a uniform and polished look, providing a professional atmosphere in the kitchen.\n\nIn summary, stainless steel offers durability, hygiene, ease of cleaning, heat resistance, and aesthetic appeal, making it an excellent choice for countertops, cooking surfaces, and appliances in a professional kitchen environment."

Various cooking utensils and items are present throughout the scene, such as numerous bottles scattered across the counters, a couple of bowls both at the larger table and on the counter near the right wall, a cup on the larger table, and a spoon on the counter near the central table.\n\nThe kitchen looks organized and efficient, as the chefs continue to work diligently on their culinary creations."
