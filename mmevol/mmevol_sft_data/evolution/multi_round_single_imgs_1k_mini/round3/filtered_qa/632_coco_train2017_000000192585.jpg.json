Flight number and arrival time: Displays should show the flight numbers and arrival times of the planes whose baggage is being unloaded onto the carousel. This enables passengers to know if they are waiting at the correct carousel corresponding to their flight.\n\n2. Estimated wait time: Providing an estimated time for luggage distribution can help passengers manage their expectations and plan accordingly.\n\n3. Luggage tracking system: Some airports have implemented luggage tracking systems that help passengers track their luggage's arrival and location on the carousel. This service can be provided through display screens and, in some cases, mobile apps.\n\n4. Baggage service office location: In case of lost, damaged, or missing luggage, passengers need to be informed about the location of the baggage service office, where they can report the issue and seek assistance.\n\n5. Clear signage and directions: At larger airports, clear directional signs should guide passengers to their assigned baggage carousel, considering there might be multiple carousels operating at the same time.\n\nBy providing these essential pieces of information in baggage claim areas, airports can ensure a more seamless and efficient process, minimizing confusion and improving the overall experience for passengers."

Some are already in the possession of passengers while others might still be on the carousel. There are also chairs scattered throughout the terminal, offering passengers a place to sit when they are not in the queue.\n\nIt seems like a typical busy day at the airport, with everyone eager to pick up their luggage and continue to their next destination."

The large crowd of people and the presence of multiple suitcases and bags in the scene could create confusion and make it challenging for individuals to quickly identify and retrieve their belongings when they arrive on the carousel. Moreover, the risk of luggage being delayed, damaged, or misplaced by the airline can also add to their worries. To address these concerns, people often place tags or identifiers on their bags to help them easily recognize their belongings when they arrive on the baggage carousel."

A few individuals are holding bags or luggage, perhaps carry-on items from their flight.\n\nThe background features a yellow and green advertisement on the wall behind the conveyor belt.
