            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To maintain a visually appealing and well-organized kitchen, the woman can follow some best practices. Firstly, she can declutter the countertops and store any unnecessary items in cabinets or shelves. For example, there are various cups, bottles, and utensils scattered on the surfaces that can be neatly placed in designated storage areas. Secondly, she should keep all essential tools and appliances, like knives, spoons, and ovens, readily accessible to make cooking and food preparation more efficient.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is cleanliness \u2013 ensuring that the kitchen is regularly cleaned can make the space feel more inviting and organized. The woman can also enhance the aesthetic appeal by adding decorative elements like the yellow and red flowers she already has in the vases on the counter. These simple touches of color and natural beauty can elevate the overall appearance of the kitchen. Additionally, she can arrange the displayed items, like vases and cups, symmetrically or in groupings to make the space look more cohesive and visually balanced."
