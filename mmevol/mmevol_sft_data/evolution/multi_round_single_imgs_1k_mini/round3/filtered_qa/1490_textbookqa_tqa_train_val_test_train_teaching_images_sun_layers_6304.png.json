            "answer": "The diagram represents the various parts of the sun. There are three main parts to the Sun's interior: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The core is at the center. It is the hottest region, where the nuclear fusion reactions that power the Sun occur. Moving outward, next comes the radiative (or radiation) zone. Its name is derived from the way energy is carried outward through this layer, carried by photons as thermal radiation. The third and final region of the solar interior is named the convective (or convection) zone. It is also named after the dominant mode of energy flow in this layer; heat moves upward via roiling convection, much like the bubbling motion in a pot of boiling oatmeal. The boundary between the Sun's interior and the solar atmosphere is called the photosphere. It is what we see as the visible \u201csurface\u201d of the Sun. The photosphere is not like the surface of a planet; even if you could tolerate the heat you couldn't stand on it. The sun has its own atmosphere. The lower region of the solar atmosphere is called the chromosphere. A thin transition region, where temperatures rise sharply, separates the chromosphere from the vast corona above. The uppermost portion of the Sun's atmosphere is called the corona, and is surprisingly much hotter than the Sun's surface (photosphere)."
