            "question": "If angle BOC in the given figure is 100 degrees, what is the measure of angle BAC? Choices: A: 50\u00b0, B: 55\u00b0, C: 60\u00b0, D: 65\u00b0",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To find the measure of angle BAC when angle BOC is given as 100\u00b0, we apply the property of circle angles where an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Therefore, angle BAC, which is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc as the central angle BOC, will be 100\u00b0/2 = 50\u00b0. The correct choice is A: 50\u00b0."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Extending lines BA and CA to form a triangle with line BC, considering that angle BAC is 50\u00b0 as derived earlier, results in an isosceles triangle. This configuration arises because the angles at the base of the triangle (ABC) remain equal due to symmetrical properties of the original circle's structure."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "If point O were not at the center, it would no longer be a central point, and thus angle BOC would not be a central angle. The relationship between angles BOC and BAC would change, making BAC not necessarily half of BOC. This would require additional information or measurements to accurately determine any angle."
