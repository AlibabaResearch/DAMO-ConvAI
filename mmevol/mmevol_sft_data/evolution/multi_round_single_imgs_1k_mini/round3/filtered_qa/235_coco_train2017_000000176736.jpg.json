            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Before riding waves in the ocean, surfers need to learn and practice various skills to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Some of these essential skills include:\n\n1. Paddling: Paddling efficiently on a surfboard is crucial for catching waves and maintaining balance. Surfers must learn how to paddle using their arms, with a proper technique to conserve energy and increase speed.\n\n2. Pop-up: The pop-up is the maneuver that allows surfers to transition from a lying position to a standing position on their surfboard. Mastering this technique is vital for catching waves and maintaining balance while surfing.\n\n3. Reading waves: Understanding wave behavior and choosing the right wave to ride is a skill that takes time to develop. Surfers must learn how to analyze waves by observing their size, shape, and direction, as well as the timing between sets.\n\n4. Balance and stance: Maintaining proper balance and stance on the surfboard is crucial for controlling the ride on a wave. Surfers need to learn how to distribute their weight effectively, bend their knees, and position their feet to enhance stability and control.\n\n5. Turning: Surfers need to learn how to control their surfboard's direction by shifting their weight and initiating turns. This skill is essential for maneuvering on waves and avoiding obstacles or other surfers.\n\n6. Etiquette and safety: Surfers must understand and respect the unwritten rules of surfing etiquette, such as right-of-way, avoiding collisions, and not invading the space of fellow surfers. Additionally, being aware of local conditions and hazards, such as rip currents and shallow reefs, is essential for maintaining safety in the water.\n\nBy mastering these fundamental skills and consistently practicing, surfers can enjoy a rewarding and exciting experience as they ride the waves in the ocean."

There are also beach umbrellas scattered throughout the area, providing shade for the beachgoers. Some personal items, such as backpacks and handbags, are placed nearby, indicating that these people may have come together for this beach outing."

            "answer": "Before beginners can start practicing surfing in the water, there are some crucial steps they need to follow, mainly focusing on learning the basics of surfing and understanding safety measures. In the image, several people are learning surfboarding on the beach while an instructor explains the process to them. The key steps beginners should consider are:\n\n1. Choose the right surfboard: Beginners should opt for longer, wider, and more stable surfboards that are more forgiving and provide better balance when starting.\n\n2. Learn proper body positioning: Understand where to place the body on the surfboard while laying down or paddling to maintain balance and avoid nose-diving.\n\n3. Master the pop-up technique: Practice getting up from a laying position to a standing position on the surfboard quickly and efficiently, ideally in one smooth motion.\n\n4. Develop paddling skills: Learn the right way to paddle with the arms while maintaining body stability on the surfboard for better control and efficient movement in the water.\n\n5. Understand wave selection and timing: Learn how to assess and identify suitable waves to ride, and understand when to start paddling and pop up on the surfboard.\n\n6. Familiarize oneself with surfing etiquette: Learning the basic rules and etiquette of surfing, such as not \"dropping in\" on another surfer's wave or respecting the line-up, is essential to maintaining a positive and safe surfing environment.\n\n7. Safety Measures: Learn about riptides, currents, and other ocean-related hazards, and be aware of how to react to them.\n\nBy following these key steps, beginners can gradually develop their skills and confidence before venturing into the water and engaging in surfing activities independently."
