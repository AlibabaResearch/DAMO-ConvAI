            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Having the oven light on while baking is useful for several reasons:\n\n1. Monitoring the progress: Having the light on allows you to clearly see the food as it cooks. This enables you to check the color, texture, and appearance of the food to determine if it is cooked correctly or if it requires more time.\n\n2. Preventing overcooking or undercooking: By keeping an eye on the cooking process, you can avoid potential issues like burning or undercooking the pizza. This helps ensure a delicious and perfectly cooked meal.\n\n3. Maintaining oven heat: Opening the oven door to check on the food releases heat from the oven, which can affect cooking times and potentially lead to uneven or prolonged cooking. Having the oven light on allows you to observe the food through the oven window without needing to open the door, thereby maintaining a consistent temperature.\n\nUsing the oven light while baking is an effective way to keep track of the cooking process and ensure that the food is cooked properly, without having to open the oven door and disturb the cooking temperature."

            "question": "What is a possible concern while baking the pizza in the oven?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "A possible concern while baking the pizza in the oven is that it is placed directly on the oven rack without using a metal tray, pizza stone, or parchment paper. Baking a pizza directly on the oven rack can lead to uneven cooking, difficulty in removing the pizza from the oven if any toppings or cheese drip onto the rack, and potentially cause a mess inside the oven that is hard to clean up later. To minimize these concerns, it would be recommended to use a proper surface like a metal tray, pizza stone, or parchment paper to provide support and ensure even cooking while making the removal process easier and the oven clean."
