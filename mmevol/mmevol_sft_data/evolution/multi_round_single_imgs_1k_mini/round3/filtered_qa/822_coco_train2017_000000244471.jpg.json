By displaying lifelike sculptures or models of the animals, the exhibit can provide a more engaging and visually interesting way to learn about these creatures, especially for younger visitors who may be more captivated by realistic representations than textual or visual descriptions alone.\n\n2. Artistic: If the museum is focused on art, the exhibit may showcase the talents and craftsmanship of the artist(s) who created the animal sculptures. In this case, the display would serve as an appreciation of the skill and creativity involved in designing and constructing detailed and lifelike representations of these animals.\n\n3. Historical or cultural: The exhibit might explore the relationship and significance of these animals in human history, culture, or mythology. For instance, it could highlight the importance of specific animals as hunting resources, symbols in ancient societies, or roles they played in folklore and legends.\n\nOverall, the exact purpose of the museum exhibit with these different animal sculptures would depend on the individual museum's goals and objectives, and the broader themes or narratives that the exhibit is meant to convey. Regardless of the specific purpose, however, the display of animals in this manner offers an engaging and immersive way for visitors to learn more about the featured creatures and their connections to various aspects of human life and history."
