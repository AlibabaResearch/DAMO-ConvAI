Trees can be seen in the background, providing a pleasant environment for the passengers.\n\nThere are several people in the scene. One person is close to the left side of the bus, two people are located farther back, and another person is standing on the right side of the bus. Another person seems to be using a cell phone near the right edge of the scene. \n\nLuggage is scattered around the area, including a handbag and a suitcase near the center of the scene, and two backpacks - one on the right side and the other near the bottom of the image. This suggests that the passengers have just arrived at their destination or are preparing to board the bus for their journey."
