            "answer": "Water is a transparent common substance that makes up the earth's oceans, lakes, seas, rivers, streams and more. Water is essential for every living thing to replenish and hydrate. The chemical formula for water contains one oxygen atom to two hydrogen atoms. Everything from the earth's crust to the human brain contain great amounts of water. Water on earth is continually being used and then goes through the water cycle to become new and usable again. The water cycle involves evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and runoff. Even though water does not have any calories or nutritional benefit it is essential to all living forms on earth. Fishing which occurs in salt and fresh type waters yields much food for the world's people. Water even involves exercise for those who like to swim and engage in other sports like water skiing, wakeboarding and so on."
