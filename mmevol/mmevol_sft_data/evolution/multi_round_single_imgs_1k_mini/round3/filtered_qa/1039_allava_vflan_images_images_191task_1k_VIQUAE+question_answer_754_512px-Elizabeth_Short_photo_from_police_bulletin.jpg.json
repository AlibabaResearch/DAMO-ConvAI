            "answer": "Without specific historical context or identifying details, it is impossible for me to accurately answer the question regarding the woman's posthumous nickname based on this image alone. Nicknames, especially posthumous ones, are often attributed to individuals based on their life achievements, impact, or notable events that are widely recognized and documented. This requires access to historical records, biographical information, or other forms of documentation that are not available within this image. If this is a historical figure, I would suggest consulting reliable historical sources or databases that specialize in biographical records to find the answer to this question. It's important to protect individuals' privacy and not make assumptions based on an image without proper context."

After weeks of painstakingly analyzing the music sheets and connecting dots others missed, Vivian uncovered that the kidnapper was a disgraced composer seeking revenge on critics who sabotaged his career.
