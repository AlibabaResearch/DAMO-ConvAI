            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To solve the problem, we use the Triangle Inequality Theorem which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Given the quadrilateral $ABCD$ with the sides $AB = 4$, $BC = 7$, $CD = 10$, and $DA = 5$, we can consider $AC$ as a diagonal, forming two triangles, $ABC$ and $ACD$. Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get:\n\n1. $AC + AB > BC \\implies AC + 4 > 7 \\implies AC > 3$\n2. $AB + BC > AC \\implies 4 + 7 > AC \\implies AC < 11$\n3. $BC + AC > AB \\implies 7 + AC > 4$ (This condition is always true for positive lengths of $AC$)\n\nSimilarly, for triangle $ACD$, we get:\n\n1. $AC + AD > CD \\implies AC + 5 > 10 \\implies AC > 5$\n2. $AD + CD > AC \\implies 5 + 10 > AC \\implies AC < 15$\n3. $CD + AC > AD \\implies 10 + AC > 5$ (This condition is always true for positive lengths of $AC$)\n\nCombining the inequalities, $AC$ must be an integer, greater than 5 and less than 11. Therefore, the possible integer lengths for $AC$ are $6, 7, 8, 9$, and $10$. The number of possible integer lengths $AC$ is \n\n5."
