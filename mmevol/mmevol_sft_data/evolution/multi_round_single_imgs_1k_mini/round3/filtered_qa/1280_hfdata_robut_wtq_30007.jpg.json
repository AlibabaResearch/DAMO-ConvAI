            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Imagine if these matches were played on planets with lower gravity, such as Mars. The reduced gravity would allow players to jump higher and run faster, leading to potentially higher-scoring games and more spectacular aerial displays. However, the thinner atmosphere could affect players' stamina and breathing, requiring them to acclimate to new conditions. On a planet with a denser atmosphere and stronger gravity than Earth, such as Jupiter's moons, the game would be slower, with more ground-based play as jumping and sprinting would be more challenging. The outcomes would depend heavily on each team's adaptability to these extreme conditions, their physical conditioning, and their ability to innovate new tactics suitable for the alien environments."
