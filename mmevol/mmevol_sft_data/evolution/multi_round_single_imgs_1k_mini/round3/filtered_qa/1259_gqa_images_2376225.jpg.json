The red train would gleam under the station lights, its colors slightly muted by the darkness. Sounds would be quieter, with the occasional murmur of conversation and the distant whistle of a train echoing in the stillness. The mood would shift to a more mysterious and contemplative atmosphere, inviting stories of late-night journeys and whispered conversations."

The trains are no longer ordinary; one is a gleaming silver dragon train with scales that shimmer, while another is a floating crystal locomotive glowing with ethereal light. The platform is made of luminescent stones that shift colors gently underfoot. The trees in the background are the guardians of the forest, their leaves made of translucent gems and their branches whispering ancient secrets. In the sky, you see not only the sun but also floating islands with cascading waterfalls. Butterflies made of light flutter around, adding to the dreamlike quality of the scene."
