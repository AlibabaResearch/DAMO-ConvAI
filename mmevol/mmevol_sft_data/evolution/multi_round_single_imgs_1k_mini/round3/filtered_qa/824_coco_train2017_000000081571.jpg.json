Additionally, public art can express a community's values or cultural identity, making the space feel more connected to its inhabitants.\n\nIn the case of the two giraffe sculptures, their imposing presence and unexpected appearance in a crowded square create a sense of wonder and visual interest, drawing people in and fostering interactions among the people standing around and looking at them. As a result, such sculptures can positively influence the public space by promoting social connections, enhancing the area's visual appeal, and providing unique experiences for visitors."
