In the image, there are a large amount of luggage pieces sitting on the carousel in the baggage claim area. With so many suitcases that may look similar, it can be difficult to recognize one's belongings at a glance.\n\nTo easily spot their luggage, people can use bright-colored or unique luggage tags, attach ribbons, use stickers, or even tie a distinct fabric around the handle or strap of the suitcase. This personalization will help travelers quickly identify their luggage among the various sets of luggage on the carousel, reducing the likelihood of missing or accidentally taking someone else's belongings."
