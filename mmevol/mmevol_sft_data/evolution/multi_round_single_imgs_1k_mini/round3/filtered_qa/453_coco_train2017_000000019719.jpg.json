            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the image, there are two zebras standing side by side in a pen. Although zebras' black and white stripes work as an excellent camouflage in their natural habitat, helping them blend in with stripes of light filtering through vegetation, their effectiveness in camouflage in the pen is limited. The grassy area and fence within the pen do not offer the same kind of cover as dense vegetation or tall grasses found in their natural environment, which makes them more easily visible and identifiable to onlookers."
