            "question": "How can I start building this website with HTML from the ground up?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To start building a website like the one shown, you can begin with a basic HTML skeleton and progressively embellish it with CSS for styling. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n1. **Basic HTML Structure**:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Website Title</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"header\">\n        <a href=\"#\" id=\"logo\"><img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\"></a>\n        <ul id=\"menu\">\n            <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#\">Services</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#\">Contact</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n        <h1>Giveaway of Sothink Flash Menu is over!</h1>\n        <div class=\"product\">\n            <img src=\"flash_menu.jpg\" alt=\"Sothink Flash Menu\">\n            <p>An ultimate Flash menu builder creates stylish & stunning cross-browser Flash drop down menu in clicks. 68 built-in templates, 50 amazing special effects, 35 preset styles and image library of 4 categories, make SE friendly navigation bar without Flash and ActionScript skills.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"product\">\n            <img src=\"swf_decompiler.jpg\" alt=\"Sothink SWF Decompiler\">\n            <p>A high-performance Flash decompiler for you to convert SWF to FLA or FLEX precisely; Easily extract all Flash resources; Convert Flash to html5 files; Replace image/shape/text/sound for SWF.

(With almost all the function that Adobe Flash has, but much cheaper than it)Stronger functions but lower price!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"footer\">\n        <p>Sothink is a trademark of SourceTec Software Co., LTD.</p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n2. **CSS for Styling**: Create a separate CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to handle the styling. A basic example to get you started:\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    color: #333;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n}\n.header {\n    background-color: #024770;\n    padding: 20px;\n}\n#menu {\n    list-style: none;\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n}\n#menu li {\n    display: inline;\n    margin-right: 20px;\n}\n.product {\n    margin: 20px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n}\n#footer {\n    background-color: #000;\n    color: #fff;\n    text-align: center;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n```\n3. **Images and Resources**: Make sure to have the images like `logo.png`, `flash_menu.jpg`, etc., in a folder accessible to your HTML file.\n\nThis structure sets up a foundational layout for your website. You can expand upon this by adding more styles, interactive elements, and advanced features as needed."
