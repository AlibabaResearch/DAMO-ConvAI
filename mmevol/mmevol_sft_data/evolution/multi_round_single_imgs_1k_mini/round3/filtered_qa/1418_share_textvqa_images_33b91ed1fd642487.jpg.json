Upon confirmation, the drone projects a holographic notice in bright neon colors: 'DO NOT OCCUPY \u2013 THIS IS SUBSTANDARD.' The hologram provides an immersive interface where passersby can access detailed reports, contact authorities directly through a virtual assistant, or scan a QR code for immediate action. NeoVegas thus ensures its citizens\u2019 safety through cutting-edge technological integration and seamless, automated governance."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The process of labeling a property as 'substandard' often involves a detailed inspection and evaluation by city officials or housing inspectors. This can begin with a complaint or report from neighbors, tenants, or even routine inspections. Inspectors assess various aspects of the property, including its structural integrity, electrical systems, plumbing, sanitation, and overall safety conditions. If significant deficiencies or violations of the housing code are found, the property is declared substandard. The owner is typically given a notice detailing the issues and a timeframe to remedy them. Failure to address these deficiencies can lead to the posting of an official notice like the one in the image, prohibiting occupancy until the property meets the required standards. The goal of such measures is to ensure safe and livable conditions in all residential properties within the city."

The appeal process typically involves submitting a written request for a hearing before a local housing or code enforcement board. During the hearing, the owner can present evidence and arguments as to why the property should not be deemed substandard. This can include documentation of recent repairs, expert testimony on the property's condition, or evidence of compliance with the housing code. The board will review the case and make a determination. If the appeal is successful, the notice may be rescinded or modified. If unsuccessful, the owner must address the cited issues to bring the property up to standard. It's essential for property owners to act promptly and provide comprehensive evidence to support their case during the appeal process."

The mural spans the entire side of a large building, using bright, arresting colors in the spirit of the original notice but incorporating intricate details and layers of meaning. At the center, the ominous 'DO NOT OCCUPY' in bold black letters is transformed into a series of dynamic street art fonts, surrounded by ghostly silhouettes of people and family figures.

Around them, urban decay and vibrant natural elements intermingle\u2014cracks and rubble intertwined with resilient flowers and greenery. Notably, there are panels within the mural portraying various community members working together\u2014repairing homes, holding meetings, and celebrating improvements\u2014highlighting the power of community action. The bottom of the mural features real stories and quotes of current and former residents, giving a powerful narrative voice to those who experienced housing insecurities.

Once a thriving industrial hub, Riverton now grapples with economic decline, leading to widespread poverty and dilapidation. The image of the 'DO NOT OCCUPY' notice becomes an all-too-common sight around neighborhoods that were once bustling with activity. Stark orange notices dot the landscape, highlighting homes that now stand vacant and substandard, posing severe safety hazards to any potential occupants. City officials, overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crisis, struggle to enforce housing codes and find suitable lodging for displaced families. Tensions rise as frustrated residents demand action, creating a palpable sense of urgency. As winter approaches, the city's temporary shelters overflow, and the orange notices become symbols of a community in distress. Amid escalating protests and mounting pressure, Riverton's mayor introduces an emergency housing initiative, seeking federal aid and engaging local stakeholders in a desperate bid to turn the tide and restore hope to the troubled city."
