            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The percentage of equity shares held by major shareholders between April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2013, was 20.00%.

            "answer": "For the period from April 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, directors and related parties held 80.00% of the equity shares. By the next fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, their holding remained the same at 80.00%. This consistent figure suggests stable ownership interest by the directors and related parties across both years."

This suggests that the company didn't have pending payments to collect from shareholders for allotted shares during this timeframe."
