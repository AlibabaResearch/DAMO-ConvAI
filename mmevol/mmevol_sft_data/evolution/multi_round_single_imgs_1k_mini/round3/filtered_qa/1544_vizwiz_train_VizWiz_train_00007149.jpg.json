            "question": "What is this?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "This is a swing training device, likely designed to improve a batter's swing in sports such as baseball or softball. By attaching it to the bat and practicing swings, the batter can work on their hitting mechanics, speed, and power."

            "question": "Could you give me more details on how this training device works?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! This type of swing trainer usually consists of a weighted ball attached to the bat with flexible rods. When a batter swings the bat, the ball provides resistance and feedback through the rods, helping refine muscle memory for a smoother, more powerful swing."

            "answer": "Yes, swing trainers like this one are typically adjustable and can be used by players of various age groups and skill levels, from young beginners to experienced adults."

            "question": "How would you use this tool during training?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "During training, a player would attach the swing trainer to their bat, taking their normal batting stance. They would then perform repeated swings, focusing on technique, to build muscle memory. Coaches often incorporate it into hitting drills to ensure consistency and proper form."

            "format": "Norm",
            "question": "Can this help prevent common batting mistakes?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Absolutely. The instant feedback from the resistance helps in correcting common mistakes such as dropping the bat's shoulder or overextending. It encourages a compact, efficient swing path directly to the ball."
