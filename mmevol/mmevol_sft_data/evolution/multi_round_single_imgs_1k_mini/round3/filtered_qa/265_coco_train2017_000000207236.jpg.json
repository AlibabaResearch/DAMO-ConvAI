Clear, visible traffic lights that help regulate the flow of traffic, especially at railway crossings and intersections.\n3. Designated pedestrian and bicycle safe crossing zones, such as crosswalks, to improve safety for those who are walking or riding bikes.\n4. Railway crossing barriers that work correctly to prevent pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles from moving through when a train is approaching or present.\n5. Driver and cyclist awareness, including obeying traffic signals, watching for pedestrians, and exercising caution around railway crossings.\n6. Ensuring that pedestrian traffic and cyclists are visible, so they can be easily seen by drivers and other road users, by wearing reflective clothing or using safety lights.\n\nBy promoting these safety measures and ensuring everyone is vigilant, the busy street scene can operate safely and smoothly for all road users."

Cars, bicycles, and a tram navigate their way through the thoroughfare, each a symbol of the city's diverse modes of transportation.\n\nA tall building stands majestically in the background, its towering presence punctuated by a red \"TN\" logo. This structure, along with the other buildings lining the street, forms a concrete canyon that frames the urban scene.\n\nThe street is adorned with trees that add a touch of nature to the otherwise man-made landscape. Their green leaves contrast beautifully with the gray of the buildings and street, providing a refreshing burst of color.\n\nScattered throughout the scene are traffic lights and signs, their red and yellow hues adding splashes of color to the cityscape. These elements guide the flow of traffic and maintain order amidst the hustle and bustle.\n\nFrom the perspective of a pedestrian on the sidewalk, one can observe all these elements in harmony - the vehicles moving, the traffic lights changing color, and people going about their day. It's a snapshot of city life, captured in one single frame."
