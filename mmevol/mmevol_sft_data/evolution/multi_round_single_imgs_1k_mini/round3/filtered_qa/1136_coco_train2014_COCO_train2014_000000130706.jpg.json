            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Based on the visible characteristics, such as the slender build and the distinct coat, it could possibly be a breed suitable for rough terrains like a Mustang or a similar type. Identifying the exact breed from the image alone is challenging without more distinctive breed markers or additional context on its origin."
