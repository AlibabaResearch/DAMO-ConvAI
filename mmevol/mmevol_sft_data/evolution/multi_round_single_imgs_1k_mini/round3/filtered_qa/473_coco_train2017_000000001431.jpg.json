            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Skateboarders can perform a variety of tricks on ramps, which typically involve precise balance, coordination, and timing. Some common ramp-related tricks include:\n\n1. Ollie: A jump in which the skater and the skateboard lift into the air without the skater using their hands to hold onto the board. The ollie is considered an essential trick to master for many other complex tricks.\n\n2. Kickflip: A trick in which the skater ollies and flips the skateboard 360 degrees in the air, spinning it lengthwise. The skater then lands back on the board after it completes the flip.\n\n3. 50-50 Grind: A trick in which the skateboarder approaches a rail or ledge and uses their momentum to slide along it on the trucks of their skateboard, while maintaining balance.\n\n4. Lip tricks: These are tricks performed on the lip or edge of the ramp. Some examples of lip tricks include the Rock to Fakie, in which the skater rolls up the ramp, touches the back trucks on the lip, and then rolls back down backward; and the Nose Stall, in which the skater rolls up the ramp, perches the skateboard's nose on the lip, and then re-enters the ramp.\n\n5. Aerials: Aerial tricks involve the skater grabbing their board or altering their body position while airborne. Examples include the Method Air, where the skater grabs the board with one hand and tweaks it to the side, and the Indy, where the skater grabs the skateboard with their back hand between their legs while in the air.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the countless skateboarding tricks that can be performed on ramps. Skaters often combine different tricks and techniques to create unique routines and express their personal style."

Two benches are situated within the park, providing seating for onlookers and skateboarders to rest. Additionally, another skateboard can be seen resting without a rider in the scene."

Being aware of other skaters nearby as there are multiple people in the image. They should practice their tricks in designated areas and maintain a safe distance from others to avoid collisions.\n3. Ensuring the skating area is free from obstacles and hazards. In the image, there are several bottles scattered around, which can pose a risk. Skaters should ensure that the park is clean and that such items are removed from the skating area to prevent accidents.\n4. Maintaining their skateboards in good condition, regularly checking for any damages, and replacing worn-out parts that could lead to accidents.\n5.

His skateboard, momentarily detached from his feet, hangs in the air below him.\n\nThe skatepark itself is populated with other individuals, their forms visible in the background. The concrete ramp on which the skateboarder performs his trick occupies the right side of the image, its gray surface contrasting with the vibrant colors of the scene.\n\nBeyond the immediate action at the skatepark, the image opens up to an expansive view of an ocean and mountains, adding a serene backdrop to the energetic foreground. The skateboarder is positioned on the left side of the image, his figure set against this picturesque landscape. The juxtaposition of intense athletic activity and tranquil nature makes for a compelling composition."
