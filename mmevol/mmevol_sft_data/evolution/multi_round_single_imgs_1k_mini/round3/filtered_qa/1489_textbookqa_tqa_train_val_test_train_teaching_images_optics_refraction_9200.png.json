            "answer": "This diagram explains the law of reflection and shows how light gets reflected from a surface. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence (i) is always equal to the angle of reflection (r). The angles of both reflected and incident ray are measured relative to the imaginary dotted-line, called normal, that is perpendicular (at right angles) to the mirror (reflective surface). On the other hand, Refraction is caused by the change in speed experienced by a wave when it changes medium. The refracted ray is a ray (drawn perpendicular to the wave fronts) that shows the direction that light travels after it has crossed over the boundary. The angle that the incident ray makes with the normal line is referred to as the angle of incidence. Similarly, the angle that the refracted ray makes with the normal line is referred to as the angle of refraction. Thus, this is what the following diagram is all about."
