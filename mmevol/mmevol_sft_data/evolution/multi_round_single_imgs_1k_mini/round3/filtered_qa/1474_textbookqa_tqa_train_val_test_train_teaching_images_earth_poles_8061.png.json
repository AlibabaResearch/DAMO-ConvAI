An imaginary line around the earth near the north pole is the arctic circle. It is located at 66.5 north of equator. An imaginary line around the earth near the south pole is the Antarctic circle. It is located at 66.5 south of equator. Equator is an imaginary line that goes round the Earth and divides it into two halves. The northern half is called northern hemisphere and the southern half is called southern hemisphere. Tropic of cancer and tropic of Capricorn are the two imaginary lines around the Earth on either side of the equator. The Tropic of Cancer is 23 26 north of it and the Tropic of Capricorn is 23 26 south of it."
