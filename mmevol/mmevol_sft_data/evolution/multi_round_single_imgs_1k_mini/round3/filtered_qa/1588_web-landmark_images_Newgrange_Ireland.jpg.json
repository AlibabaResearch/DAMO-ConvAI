            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Newgrange is not just a visually striking monument; it holds immense historical significance. Constructed around 3200 BC, it predates the pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge. This ancient site is widely believed to have been a burial mound or a ceremonial site.

This astronomical precision suggests advanced knowledge in astronomy among its builders. Newgrange is part of the Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and remains an enduring symbol of Neolithic ingenuity and sophistication."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "A day in the life of someone living during the construction of Newgrange would be deeply tied to the rhythms of nature and community. As the morning fog lifted from the Boyne Valley, the people might gather for communal activities, whether it be hunting, farming, or constructing the monument itself. Skilled workers would haul and position massive stones with meticulous care, their efforts coordinated by some form of leader or architect. Others might craft tools, prepare food, or tend to children. Spiritual leaders could conduct rituals, compensating the labor with ceremonies meant to appease gods or ancestors. As the sun set, marking the passage of another day, the people would retreat to their dwellings, sharing stories and meals around the fire, bound by a collective sense of purpose and tradition."
