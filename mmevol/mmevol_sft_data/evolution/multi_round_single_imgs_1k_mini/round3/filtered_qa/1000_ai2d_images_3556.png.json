The inner ear contains the vestibular system, which includes semicircular canals filled with fluid and tiny hairs. As we move, the fluid inside these canals shifts, causing the hairs to bend and send nerve signals to the brain about the body's orientation and motion. This helps us keep our balance and coordination."
