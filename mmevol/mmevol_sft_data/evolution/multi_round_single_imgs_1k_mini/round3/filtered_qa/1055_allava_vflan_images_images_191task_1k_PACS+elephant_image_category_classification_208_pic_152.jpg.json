            "question": "You will be given an image of an elephant. The image could be of different categories like painting, cartoon, photograph, or sketch. Identify the image category. \nOptions: (a) Cartoon (b) Photograph (c) Art painting (d) Sketch",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The depicted elephant falls under the category of a cartoon (a). This conclusion is supported by several distinguishing features of the image. It showcases exaggerated anatomical traits such as oversized ears and a simplified body outline, combined with vivid, whimsical colors that are not typically found in natural settings. Additionally, the elephant exhibits an emotional expression reflective of joyful characteristics often attributed to cartoon characters. The use of flat, uniform color fills and the absence of detailed textural elements further solidify its classification as a cartoon, rather than a photograph, a detailed art painting, or a sketch."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The design of the cartoon elephant is carefully tailored to captivate children.

The soft, rounded contours of the elephant's body make it appear safe and cuddly. Moreover, the choice of gentle, pastel colors adds to this allure, making it visually appealing and engaging for children by evoking a sense of warmth and comfort."
