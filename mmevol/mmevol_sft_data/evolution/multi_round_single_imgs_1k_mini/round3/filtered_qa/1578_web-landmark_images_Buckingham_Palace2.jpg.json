            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Buckingham Palace has a rich history dating back to the early 18th century. Originally known as Buckingham House, it was built in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham. In 1761, King George III acquired it for Queen Charlotte, and it became known as the Queen\u2019s House. Significant expansions and changes were made in the 19th century under the direction of architects like John Nash and Edward Blore, transforming it into the grand palace we see today. It officially became the royal residence of the British monarch with Queen Victoria\u2019s accession to the throne in 1837. Since then, it has served as the administrative headquarters of the monarchy, hosting state occasions, royal banquets, and other official functions."

Instead of traditional stone, the walls would be constructed from translucent, shimmering materials that change color with the planetary cycles. The gardens would be populated with exotic, glowing flora and fauna unique to the planet, creating a surreal and magical landscape. Functionally, the palace would serve not only as the residence of an intergalactic monarch but also as a hub for interplanetary diplomacy, with advanced technology integrating seamlessly with the natural environment to ensure sustainable living and communication across the cosmos."
