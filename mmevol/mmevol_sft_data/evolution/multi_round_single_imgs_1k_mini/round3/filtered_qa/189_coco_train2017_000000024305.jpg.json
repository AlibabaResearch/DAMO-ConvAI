            "answer": "The cake-cutting tradition at weddings has a long history and is practiced in many cultures around the world. It is often a significant part of the wedding reception, symbolizing the shared joy of the newlywed couple and their joint commitment to provide sustenance and happiness to each other.\n\nIn the past, the cake was considered a symbol of fertility and prosperity, and sharing it with guests was believed to pass on those blessings to those in attendance. Over time, the wedding cake has evolved from simple barley cakes or fruitcakes into elaborate and artistic confections with multiple tiers and intricate decorations. Today, wedding cakes can be made from various ingredients, but most prominently feature sponges or layers filled with frosting, fruit, or even liqueur.\n\nThe cake-cutting ceremony, where the couple jointly cuts the first piece of the cake, represents their first joint action as a married couple and symbolizes their unity and partnership. It is often accompanied by upbeat music or a celebratory announcement, and sometimes, the couple will feed each other the first bites of the cake to further demonstrate their commitment to nurturing and supporting each other in their married life.\n\nFurthermore, the cake-cutting event frequently involves photographed moments as it marks the beginning of the reception festivities. This time-honored tradition allows guests to witness the couple's bond and share in their joy and happiness as they embark on the next chapter of their lives together."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The couple might choose to have a smaller wedding cake for a variety of reasons, such as personal preferences, budget considerations or due to the nature of their wedding ceremony, which might be a smaller, more intimate event with fewer guests. A small wedding cake can still be elegant and meaningful, while also being more cost-effective and in line with the vibe of a close-knit gathering. In the image, it appears that the wedding ceremony is held outdoors and possibly has a more casual setting. The size of the cake may have been specifically chosen to fit the scale and theme of their wedding celebration."
