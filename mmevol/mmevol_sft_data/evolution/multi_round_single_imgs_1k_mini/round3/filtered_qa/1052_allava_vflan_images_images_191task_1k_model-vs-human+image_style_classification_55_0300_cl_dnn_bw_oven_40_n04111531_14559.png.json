            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The artistic style of this image can be characterized as monochromatic food photography. This approach emphasizes texture, form, and the interplay of light and shadow, bringing attention to the subject's details. The lack of color directs the viewer's focus to the visual elements and the composition. The simplicity of the setup, with no extraneous elements, aligns with minimalist aesthetics. Moreover, the high contrast and sharp detail lend a modern, graphic quality to the photograph, celebrating the visual appeal of roasted food."
