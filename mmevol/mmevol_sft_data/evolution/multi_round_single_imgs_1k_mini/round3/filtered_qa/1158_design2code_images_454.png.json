            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! Developing a website with HTML involves several steps. First, you need to define the structure of your pages using HTML tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, etc. Inside the <body> tag, you'll lay out the content sections with <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, etc. You'll create the navigation with <ul> and <li> inside the <nav> tag. For content, you'll use tags like <h1> for main titles, <p> for paragraphs, and <a> for links. Don't forget to link your CSS file within the <head> section for styling, and possibly JavaScript for interactivity. Once you have your basic HTML file, you can test it in a browser, and then use a tool like Git for version control and an FTP program to upload your files to a web server."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To improve the layout, I'd recommend aligning the text content to increase readability, resizing the blue squares to fit the actual images that will replace them, and ensuring that spacing and margins create a balanced, aesthetically pleasing appearance. Also, consider adding informative headings and call-to-action buttons to guide users more effectively."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! To develop a website like the one featured for Tandem Studio, which specializes in bespoke furniture, you would begin by setting up a basic HTML structure. This includes defining your headers, sections, and footers. You might also incorporate elements that showcase your work, such as a gallery for previously made furniture or testimonials. Include forms for customer inquiries and dynamically display content like available designs or materials that customers can choose from. Adding CSS for aesthetics and JavaScript for interactive elements, like a color or material selector, can significantly enhance the user's experience. Each page should emphasize bespoke services, inviting users to get in touch for custom designs, which aligns perfectly with the nature of a bespoke furniture business."
