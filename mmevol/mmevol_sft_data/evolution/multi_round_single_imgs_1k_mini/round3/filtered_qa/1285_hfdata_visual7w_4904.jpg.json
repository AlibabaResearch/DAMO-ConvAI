One day, a curious young human named Lydia stumbled upon the grove while exploring. She found herself enveloped in a warm glow and, with the zebras watching from afar, hesitantly made a wish for endless joy and harmony among all creatures. The grove shimmered, and from that day forward, the land was filled with an unbroken peace, forever watched over by the guardians in their striped cloaks."

As a final touch, they\u2019ve pooled their best squeals and brays into a harmonious birthday song that echoes across the savanna, ready to surprise their beloved herd leader."
