    "question": "What best defines the larva stage in this life cycle?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "In this life cycle, the larva stage is specifically defined as the caterpillar phase, where it focuses on feeding and growing through multiple molts."

    "question": "Could you explain the significance of the adult stage depicted in the diagram?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The adult stage illustrated in the diagram is significant as it represents the final phase of the butterfly's life cycle, capable of reproduction and continuing the cycle by laying eggs."

    "question": "Can you elaborate on the changes occurring during metamorphosis from larva to adult?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "During metamorphosis, profound changes occur as the caterpillar transforms into the adult butterfly. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar's body is reorganized, and it develops new structures like wings and reproductive organs, preparing it for adult life."

    "question": "Why might the placement of butterfly eggs on leaves be advantageous?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The placement of butterfly eggs on the undersides of leaves is advantageous as it offers protection from potential predators, shields them from extreme weather conditions, and ensures immediate access to food for the hatching caterpillars."
