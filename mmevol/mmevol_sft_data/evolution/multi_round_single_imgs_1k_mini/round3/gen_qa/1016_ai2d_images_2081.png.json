    "question": "Illustrate the process of energy flow within this food chain.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Energy flow in this food chain initiates with the producers that capture solar energy through photosynthesis. This energy is then passed on to primary consumers, such as the moose and salmon, as they consume the plants. Finally, the brown bear, as a secondary consumer, derives energy from these primary consumers, continuing the energy transfer along the food chain."
