    "question": "What does the label 'n=1' signify in the diagram?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "'n=1' signifies the first energy level or ground state of the electron in the atom. This indicates that it is the closest energy level to the nucleus, where the electron is most stable and has the lowest energy."

    "question": "What phenomenon is illustrated by the transition between energy levels in this diagram?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The transition between energy levels illustrated in this diagram represents the phenomenon of quantum leaps, where an electron absorbs or emits energy to move between defined energy states, resulting in the emission or absorption of light."

    "question": "Could you elaborate on the role of the black circle in the center?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The black circle in the center represents the nucleus of the atom. It is the core component that contains protons and neutrons, providing the positive charge that attracts the negatively charged electrons in the surrounding energy levels."
