    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten sample presents similar concepts with minimal increase in length and complexity. The phrasing is slightly more sophisticated but lacks significant semantic or visual complexity."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "While the rewritten answer maintains clarity, it does not provide greater detail or complexity than the original. The length remains similar with no substantial increase in complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten sample improves by explicitly stating the significance of the adult stage, adding more context and complexity compared to the original. It's longer and incorporates additional details."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten answer elaborates more on metamorphosis, providing detail about the internal processes that occur during this transformation, thus increasing the complexity and informative aspect."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten sample maintains the original concept but does not enhance the complexity significantly. It reiterates the functional benefits without adding further detail or variations."}
