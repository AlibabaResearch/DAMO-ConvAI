    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten sample is similar in length and complexity. Although there is slight rephrasing, the semantic complexity remains nearly the same, reflecting a minimal improvement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "While the rewritten answer provides clarification, the overall structure and complexity are similar to the original. The semantic change is minor, hence no significant improvement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten version maintains similar length and complexity, with slight rephrasing but no significant semantic enhancements."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten response offers a narrative style, but the complexity level is still comparable to the original. It enhances engagement but does not substantially elevate semantic complexity."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten sample adds slight elaboration but largely echoes the original content. The complexity does not meaningfully surpass the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Although there's a narrative flow in the rewritten sample, it does not significantly increase in length or semantic complexity beyond the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Both versions involve specifics about nutrient transport, but the rewritten answer does not enhance the complexity level beyond the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten version captures similar content and complexity as the original, with no significant enhancements in length or semantic depth."}
