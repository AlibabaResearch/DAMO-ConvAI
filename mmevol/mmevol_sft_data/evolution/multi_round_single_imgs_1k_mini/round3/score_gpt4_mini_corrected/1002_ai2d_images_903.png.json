    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rewritten sample adds depth through detailed analysis of predator-prey dynamics and the role of grasses, enhancing semantic complexity and providing a structured argument."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "This version elaborates on the consequences of a decline in snake population with a focus on the cascading effects on mice and grasshoppers, signifying improved depth and complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 9, "reason": "The rewritten response thoroughly evaluates energy flow and its implications, demonstrating deep ecological understanding and introducing layered ecological principles, thus enhancing overall complexity."}
