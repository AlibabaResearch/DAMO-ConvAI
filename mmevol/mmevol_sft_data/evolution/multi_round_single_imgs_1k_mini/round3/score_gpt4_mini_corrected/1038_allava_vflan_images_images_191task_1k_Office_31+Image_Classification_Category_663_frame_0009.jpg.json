    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten sample has improved by better focusing on specific domains with clearer language, though the complexity increase is moderate."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 2, "reason": "No significant change in length or semantic complexity; the rewrite is less descriptive."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten version is more structured and concise, providing innovative methods clearly categorized."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 2, "reason": "Minimal improvement in length or complexity; the interaction is considered too basic."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten version provides a contextual historical view, enhancing the complexity slightly."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewrite simplifies the scenario but maintains some narrative scope; however, it is less engaging."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "Significantly enhances the scenario's complexity with detailed functionalities of advanced technology."}
