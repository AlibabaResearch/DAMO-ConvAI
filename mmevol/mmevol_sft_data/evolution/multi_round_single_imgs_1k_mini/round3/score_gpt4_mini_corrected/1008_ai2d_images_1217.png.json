    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "Significant increase in both length and semantic complexity. The rewritten sample requires a deeper understanding of cellular functions and processes, inviting critical thinking about interactions."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "Enhancement in detail and length, with a clear focus on the dynamic relationship between organelles. It forces the responder to consider functional adaptations under stress, promoting critical analysis."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "Notable increase in length and complexity, linking multiple components of the cell and their roles. This fosters a deeper understanding of plant cell defense mechanisms and homeostasis."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "Increased complexity by analyzing the interactions of multiple cell components and their roles in growth and environmental response. This demands a higher level of critical thinking compared to the original samples."}
