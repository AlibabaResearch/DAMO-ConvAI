The book likely contains instructions or techniques relevant to the dish he’s preparing. The presence of the oven further suggests he may be planning to cook something that requires baking or roasting. Given that the man is chopping ingredients, it’s reasonable to deduce he might be following a recipe for a baked casserole or a similar dish that necessitates both preparation and use of the oven later. This reflects a structured cooking process where he prepares components before transitioning them into the oven for completion."
