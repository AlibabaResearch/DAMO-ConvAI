    "question": "Can you identify the specific layer of the Earth that comprises sand and vegetation? Provide a comprehensive explanation about its significance?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The specific layer of the Earth that comprises sand and vegetation is the Earth's surface. This top layer consists of various elements including sand, soil, and vegetation, which includes grasses, trees, and other plant life. It is essential for supporting life and is the most familiar part of our planet."

    "question": "What processes occur at a fault line? Provide three reasons outlining the significance of these events.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "1. A fault line is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock, where movements can occur. 2. These movements are capable of generating earthquakes, releasing built-up stress suddenly. 3. Such geological activities can shape landscapes significantly over time."

    "steps": [],
    "answer": "1. The lithosphere consists of the crust and the upper mantle. 2. It is fragmented into tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. 3. The movement of these plates causes geological events like earthquakes and volcanic activity."

    "steps": [],
    "answer": "1. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes would cease, altering Earth's dynamic processes. 2. The stopping of mountain-building activities would lead to a flatter landscape over time. 3. Nutrient recycling from deep Earth would halt, affecting ecological processes."
