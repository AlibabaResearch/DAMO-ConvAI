    "question": "What does label G in the image indicate?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Label G in the image indicates a leaf, which is essential for photosynthesis as it captures sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, providing energy for the plant's growth."

    "question": "How does the petiole contribute to the leaf's function?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The petiole connects the leaf to the stem, allowing for the transportation of water, nutrients, and sugars between the leaf and the rest of the plant. This connection ensures that the leaf can perform photosynthesis effectively."

    "question": "Explain the significance of the internode in the plant's structure.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The internode provides structural support to the plant, allowing it to grow taller and reach towards sunlight. It helps in the elongation of stems, which is crucial for the optimal positioning of leaves for photosynthesis."

    "question": "If this plant could express its thoughts, how might it describe its lifecycle?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "If this plant could express its thoughts, it might say: 'I start as a seed, germinating and pushing my roots into the soil for nourishment. As I grow, my stem rises and my leaves spread open to capture sunlight. Eventually, I bloom flowers, allowing me to reproduce and continue my legacy in the ecosystem.'"

    "question": "In what way does this plant interact with other organisms in its habitat?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "This plant interacts with various organisms in its habitat by providing food and shelter. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, while its leaves and stems offer habitats for insects and birds. Moreover, its roots help maintain soil structure and support a range of microorganisms that contribute to soil health."

    "question": "Trace the path of a nutrient from the roots to the flower.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "A nutrient begins its journey as it is absorbed by the root hairs from the soil. It travels through the root cortex, entering the xylem where it is carried upward through the stem. As the nutrient moves up, it reaches the flower through the vascular system, where it supports the development and functioning of the flower's tissues, playing a crucial role in reproduction."

    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "What consequences might arise if the main root is compromised?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "If the main root is compromised, the plant would struggle to access water and nutrients from the soil, potentially leading to wilting and stunted growth. The stability of the plant would also be affected, increasing its vulnerability to environmental stresses and making it difficult for the plant to thrive."
