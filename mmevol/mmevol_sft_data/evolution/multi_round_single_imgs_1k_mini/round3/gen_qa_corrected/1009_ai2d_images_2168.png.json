    "question": "Can you describe the role of males during the spawning process in this lifecycle depiction?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "During the spawning process, males play a crucial role by fertilizing the eggs laid by the females. After a female constructs a 'Redd' by digging a nest in the gravel, the male deposits his milt over the eggs, ensuring fertilization. This collaborative process is vital for the next generation of salmon."

    "question": "What are the typical behaviors exhibited by salmon during the 'Fry' stage?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "During the 'Fry' stage, young salmon are typically very small and rely on their yolk sacs for nutrition. They exhibit behaviors such as remaining close to the gravel for protection and begin learning to swim effectively and forage for food as they start growing into their later stages."

    "question": "What physiological changes occur as salmon transition from 'Parr' to 'Smolt'?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "As salmon transition from 'Parr' to 'Smolt,' significant physiological changes occur, including alterations in osmoregulatory functions, enabling them to adapt to saltwater environments. Additionally, their body shape and coloration change to help them blend into marine habitats, preparing them for life in the ocean."
