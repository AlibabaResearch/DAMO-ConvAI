    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten sample is less complex than original due to reduced detail about the plant's roles beyond just roots."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "While it adds some depth regarding the roots, it simplifies the overall explanation and narrows the focus without significant enhancement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten answer specifies a process but loses broader context about photosynthesis and its significance."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Although the scenario introduces challenges, it lacks the depth of the original and fails to cover the plant's full potential responses."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "While slightly improved in detail, it doesnâ€™t add significant complexity or depth beyond expressing gratitude."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Focus remains on soil contamination's impact but loses detail about broader environmental effects."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "While maintaining some situational details, it simplifies the description of habitats and potentially diminishes complexity."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "Reduces complexity surrounding adaptations and instead focuses more overtly on limitations without nuanced insights."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "While it specifies metrics about root health, it does not improve in detail compared to the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "Maintains general context but simplifies the conditions necessary for monitoring without enhancing complexity."}
