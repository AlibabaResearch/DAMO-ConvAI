    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten sample demonstrates a substantial increase in length and descriptive detail, enhancing the semantic complexity and clarity by outlining a step-by-step process that was less explicit in the original."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten version adds additional context and clarity while retaining the original task. The inclusion of evaluating the mysterious scroll provides extra semantic complexity, though it diverges slightly from the main task of finding the book."}
