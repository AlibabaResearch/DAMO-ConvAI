    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "Similar to the first sample, the rewritten question discusses a completely different body part (eye) resulting in a loss of relevance compared to its original context."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Although it expands upon the function of the nose, it does not maintain the original focus of discussing the ear's contributions, making it less aligned with the original inquiry."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "This rewritten sample has shifted focus to hair, straying from the specifics of the ear and resulting in less overall relevance to the original set."}
