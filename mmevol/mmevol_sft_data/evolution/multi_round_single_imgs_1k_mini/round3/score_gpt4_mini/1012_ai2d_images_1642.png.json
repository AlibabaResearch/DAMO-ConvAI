    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten sample has a similar level of complexity but replaces solar eclipses with lunar eclipses, creating a minor change without substantial improvement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The complexity slightly increased, but the overall semantic depth did not improve significantly compared to the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rephrased question retains similar complexity and detail, with no added sophistication or significant elaboration."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten version introduces cultural interpretations, adding depth and increased semantic complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "While a notable event is mentioned, the scope of the answer is slightly more detailed than in the original."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The rewritten answer expands on the hypothetical situation, adding more detailed implications and potential outcomes."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rephrased answer introduces technological implications, significantly increasing complexity and thought-provoking content."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 9, "reason": "This revision expands on the scientific utilization of lunar eclipses, increasing detail and depth about spectral analysis and its applications."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rewritten version emphasizes community experience and emotional responses, enhancing the engagement and descriptive complexity."}
