    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten response significantly details the internode's importance and function, increasing both length and complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten version provides a clearer narrative of the lifecycle with a more engaging tone and maintains a good length."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten response elaborates on organism interactions and specifies multiple ecological roles, improving complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten sample offers a clearer depiction of nutrient transport and more detailed descriptions, enhancing the semantic density."},
