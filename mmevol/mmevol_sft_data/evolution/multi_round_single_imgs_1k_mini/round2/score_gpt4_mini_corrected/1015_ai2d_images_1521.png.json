    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten sample provides a more detailed explanation of the outermost layer's significance and relates it to electron configurations, increasing complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The revised sample includes additional detail on the context of the 'Î”E = hv' notation, enhancing semantic complexity while explaining electron transitions more thoroughly."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The rewritten version expands on the significance of the colors and describes their relationship with energy levels and transitions in more detail, improving both length and complexity."}
