    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewriting maintains a similar length and complexity. The changes mainly involve small rephrasing of wording, without significant enhancement in depth."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "This revised question specifies the function of ribosomes, increasing semantic complexity, and replacing vague terms with more precise language."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The question now highlights the contribution of the Golgi apparatus more explicitly, enhancing length and semantic detail."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The added specificity in differentiating smooth ER and rough ER increases the clarity and complexity of the information presented."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The revised answer makes the significance of calcium oxalate crystals clearer, enhancing both length and semantic nuance."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The imaginative context adds a narrative element that significantly increases complexity and visual imagination compared to the original."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The revision introduces a realistic scenario while maintaining clarity about the vacuole's function, making the explanation more complete."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The response remains straightforward and does not exhibit significant change in complexity compared to the original."}
