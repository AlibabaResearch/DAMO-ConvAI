    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten sample simplifies the question about parts above the soil to focus solely on roots, reducing the overall thematic complexity. While the language is more precise, it lacks the richness of detail provided in the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten question asks about roots supporting health but removes some detail on photosynthesis. The complexity is moderately maintained but shifts focus from above-ground processes to roots only, limiting the scope."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The new question is focused on adaptations of roots, which is specific, but it loses the broader ecological context of how leaves and the entire plant respond to environmental conditions."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "Although it introduces the concept of a 'typical day' for roots, it simplifies the discussion of overall plant functions and dynamics present in the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten question removes context about the plant's broader requirements and focuses specifically on watering, which is less comprehensive."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "This question introduces the impact of a fungal infection, which is complex, but it is a less detailed and less interconnected view compared to the original's holistic representation of plant health."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The environmental context is limited, with a more narrow focus on root structures rather than the full plant ecology as originally described."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "Questions about rocky terrain simplify the habitat discussion from earlier; while it addresses adaptability, it narrows down from the broader habitat analysis."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten question about research focuses solely on root data, which is relevant but lacks the diverse aspects of plant study mentioned in the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The focus on root observation frequency is meaningful, but the scope is limited to roots instead of the plant's holistic health, leading to less overall complexity."}
