    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten sample maintains a similar level of complexity in terms of length and semantic detail, but focuses specifically on the chairs rather than the keychain and its context, resulting in a loss of a broader visual narrative."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "While the rewritten query specifies details about the armchair's design, the overall complexity remains low, lacking unique elements or richer contexts."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "This sample envisions an activity involving the chairs; however, it lacks the depth of contextual storytelling seen in the original concerning the keychain."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The idea of a hidden feature is interesting but does not enhance the complexity as much since it is focused solely on the chairs without broader visual relationships."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "The futuristic design concepts add some complexity but still feel somewhat generic compared to the unique context provided in the original samples."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "This imaginative scenario, while engaging, does not reach the same level of detail and context as the original scene involving the keychain."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "This scenario captures a realistic setting well, but lacks the interactive elements and unique context specific to the original, focusing instead on general family dynamics."}
