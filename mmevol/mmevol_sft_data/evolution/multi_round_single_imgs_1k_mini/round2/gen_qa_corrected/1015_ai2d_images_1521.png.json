        "answer": "The outermost layer indicated in the image is the one labeled 'n=3'. This diagram illustrates the electron energy levels in quantum mechanics, where 'n' signifies the principal quantum number. The outermost layer represents the highest energy level, indicating that electrons in this shell are further from the nucleus compared to those in lower energy levels, hence influencing chemical properties."

        "answer": "The arrow labeled with 'ΔE = hv' signifies the energy transition of an electron as it moves between energy levels, either gaining or releasing energy in the form of a photon. Here, 'ΔE' denotes the energy difference between the initial and final states of the electron, while 'h' is Planck's constant and 'v' signifies the photon's frequency, encapsulating how energy quantization occurs in atomic systems."
