    "question": "What is the composition of the Earth’s crust?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The Earth's crust is mainly composed of a variety of rocks and minerals, consisting predominantly of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. It includes elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminum, and iron, which combine to form minerals like feldspar, quartz, and mica. This crustal layer varies in thickness and is crucial for supporting terrestrial life."

    "question": "How do tectonic movements result in earthquakes?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Tectonic movements lead to earthquakes through the build-up of stress at fault lines. When the tectonic plates move, they can become locked due to friction. As pressure builds, the stress is released suddenly, causing the ground to shake. This release of energy propagates as seismic waves, leading to an earthquake."

    "question": "What long-term impacts can result from fault line activity?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Activity along fault lines can lead to significant long-term impacts such as the formation of mountain ranges and valleys due to uplift and subsidence processes. These geological changes can subsequently alter ecosystems, create new habitats, and affect human infrastructure, leading to zones vulnerable to landslides and geological hazards."

    "question": "What are some beneficial geological processes resulting from tectonic activity?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Beneficial geological processes resulting from tectonic activity include the creation of fertile soils from volcanic ash, the formation of mineral deposits that are essential for economy and technology, and the development of natural landscapes that support diverse ecosystems. These processes can enhance agricultural productivity and biodiversity."

    "question": "In what ways does the lithosphere contribute to Earth’s environmental balance?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The lithosphere contributes to Earth's environmental balance by facilitating nutrient recycling through weathering of rocks, which enriches the soil. Additionally, it plays a critical role in the carbon cycle by storing carbon in mineral forms and regulating greenhouse gases through volcanic emissions. This dynamic interaction supports diverse life forms on the planet."

    "question": "What are the ecological implications if tectonic plate movement ceases?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "If tectonic plate movement ceases, it would halt volcanic activity and earthquake occurrences, leading to diminished soil fertility over time due to lack of volcanic material. Furthermore, ecosystem dynamics would be altered, as certain species rely on the geological processes for habitat formation and nutrient supply, potentially leading to biodiversity loss."

    "question": "What if the majority of the Earth's surface became urbanized?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "If the Earth's surface became predominantly urbanized, it would drastically reduce natural habitats, impacting biodiversity negatively. Increased pollution and modified land surfaces could lead to altered climate conditions, exacerbating urban heat effects. This transformation would also challenge resource management as human populations demand more land, water, and energy, creating conflicts with natural ecosystems."
