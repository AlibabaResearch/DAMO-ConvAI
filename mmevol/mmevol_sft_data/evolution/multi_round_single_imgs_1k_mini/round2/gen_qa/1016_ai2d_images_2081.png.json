    "question": "Describe the flow of energy starting from the producers to the secondary consumers in this diagram.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Energy flow in this food chain begins with the producers (flowers, grass, or water plants) that convert solar energy through photosynthesis. Primary consumers, such as deer and moose, then consume these producers to gain energy. Finally, secondary consumers like the brown bear obtain energy by preying on these primary consumers, showcasing the interconnectedness of the food web."
