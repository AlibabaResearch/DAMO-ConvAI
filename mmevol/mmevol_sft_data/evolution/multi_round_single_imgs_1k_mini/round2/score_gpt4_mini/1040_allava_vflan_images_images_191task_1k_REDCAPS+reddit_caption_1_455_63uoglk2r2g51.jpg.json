    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The inclusion of options adds a layer of decision-making complexity to the question, improving the engagement level without greatly expanding on length."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten version is similar in length and content. Although it requests a narrative, its overall complexity has not significantly changed."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "While the answer adds elements of storytelling, its essence remains similar to the original, with no significant enhancement in complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The emphasis on a memorable line encourages creativity and engages with the character's essence more deeply than the original."},
