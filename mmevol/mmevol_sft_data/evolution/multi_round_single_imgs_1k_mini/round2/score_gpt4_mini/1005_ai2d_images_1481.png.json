    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten sample has a similar level of complexity to the original, with a bit more technical detail, but the essence of the question has not significantly changed."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "There is slight elaboration on the role of transpiration, but it remains at a comparable complexity to the original question."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten version provides a little more detail, but overall complexity remains similar with no major enhancements."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The explanation of evaporation remains straightforward, with only slight increases in phrasing and context."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten response gives more detail on the consequences of evaporation disruption but does not increase in complexity significantly."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "The story of Aqua adds a narrative touch but doesn't significantly enhance complexity compared to the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten answer provides more detail but maintains a similar overarching conceptual complexity."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 7, "reason": "The explanation specifies the benefits more clearly, resulting in slightly increased semantic complexity."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 7, "reason": "The idea of a different planet introduces some variations, but overall complexity does not see a significant enhancement."}
