    {"improved": "no", "score": 2, "reason": "The rewritten question is slightly longer, but it maintains similar semantic complexity and does not add significant detail."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten answer provides two distinct rationales, enhancing complexity and requiring critical thinking."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten question explicitly asks for justification, improving semantic complexity and depth of answer."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The rewritten answer presents a clearer structure regarding energy flow, enhancing complexity and detail."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rewritten answer is more concise while still effectively communicating the ecological consequences of a decrease in snake population, demonstrating improved complexity."}
