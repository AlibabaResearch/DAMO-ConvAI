    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The prompt for a 'short monologue' adds a creative element, but overall complexity remains similar."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "While the question prompts interaction, it mostly reiterates the original without notable complexity changes."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten question explicitly asks for a complete outline, enhancing structure and complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten question emphasizes potential consequences with clear language, inviting a comprehensive response."}
