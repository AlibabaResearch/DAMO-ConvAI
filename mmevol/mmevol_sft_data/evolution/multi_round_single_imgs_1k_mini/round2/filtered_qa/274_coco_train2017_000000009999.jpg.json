            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The young man skateboarding down the busy city street faces multiple potential risks due to the heavy traffic and various types of vehicles on the road, such as cars, buses, and trucks. The risks include:\n\n1. Collisions: The skateboarder is at a higher risk of colliding with a vehicle or pedestrian, which can result in serious injuries.\n\n2. Visibility issues: Drivers may not expect a skateboarder on the road, making them less likely to notice or react quickly to the skateboarder's presence, further increasing the risk of a collision.\n\n3. Maneuverability limitations: Skateboarders typically have less maneuverability than a car, making it difficult for them to avoid sudden obstacles or changes in traffic flow.\n\n4. Road conditions: The road conditions, such as uneven surfaces or debris, can pose a danger to skateboarders, potentially leading to falls and subsequent injuries.\n\n5. Distraction for other road users: The presence of a skateboarder on the road can cause distractions for drivers and pedestrians, potentially leading to accidents involving other road users.\n\nGiven these risks, it is crucial for the young man to exercise caution while skateboarding on busy city streets and for other road users to remain vigilant and give the skateboarder ample space to safely navigate the traffic."
