            "question": "How do the cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitory areas located in the medulla oblongata influence heart rate?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitory areas within the medulla oblongata play a crucial role in regulating heart rate through the autonomic nervous system. The cardioaccelerator center activates the sympathetic nervous system, releasing norepinephrine which increases heart rate and the force of heart contractions. On the other hand, the cardioinhibitory center stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, primarily through the vagus nerve, releasing acetylcholine which slows down the heart rate and decreases the force of contractions. This dynamic balance ensures the heart adapts to varying physiological demands efficiently."
