            "answer": "The purpose of the buses at the airport is to transport passengers between the airport terminal and the planes parked at remote locations on the tarmac. These vehicles, sometimes called \"airport shuttles\" or \"tram buses,\" play an essential role in ensuring that passengers can disembark from their planes and reach the terminal efficiently or vice versa. They are particularly useful when planes cannot be parked directly at an airport gate due to limited space or other operational constraints, and they help keep airport operations running smoothly by facilitating the safe and timely transportation of passengers."

There are two buses, one situated on the right side of the image, and the other close to the center, parked near the airplanes. \n\nIn addition to the vehicles, three people are scattered throughout the scene. One person is positioned towards the left side, while the other two people are on the right side. Furthermore, there are two trucks visible, one near the center and the other slightly to its right. A car can also be seen, parked near the center of the scene. The overall scene captures the dynamic environment of an airport, with various vehicles and people moving about the tarmac."

The tarmac, a vast expanse of gray, is adorned with white lines and markings that guide the orchestrated movements of the airport's vehicles and personnel.\n\nThree airplanes are stationed in the background, their tails painted in distinct colors that hint at their respective airlines. One airplane sports a vibrant tail of red and yellow, another has a tail adorned in blue and white, while the third airplane has a tail that is purely white.\n\nTwo buses, one white and the other blue, are parked on the tarmac, ready to transport passengers to and from the airplanes. A person clad in a blue uniform is seen walking near the buses, perhaps attending to his duties on this busy day at the airport.\n\nThe image paints a picture of the organized chaos that is typical of an airport tarmac, where every vehicle and person has a role to play in ensuring smooth operations."
