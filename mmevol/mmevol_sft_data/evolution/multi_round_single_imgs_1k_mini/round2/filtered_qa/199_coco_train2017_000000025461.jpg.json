            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Oriental musical groups often feature traditional instruments and styles from countries in Asia, particularly East Asia. The term \"oriental\" serves as a broad category encompassing various cultures, traditions, and instruments. However, it's essential to note that the use of the term \"oriental\" can be considered outdated and inappropriate in some contexts due to its association with Eurocentric views and stereotypes of the East.\n\nTraditional oriental music might include instruments such as drums, stringed instruments like the erhu, guzheng, or koto, as well as woodwind instruments like the dizi or shakuhachi. The use of drums in these musical groups varies depending on the specific region, culture, and style. Drums are often featured in traditional music for their rhythmic qualities, and they can play a central role in setting the tempo or creating a percussive backdrop for other instruments.\n\nDrums can be found in numerous different shapes and sizes, ranging from small hand drums to larger, more resonant drums. Some traditional Asian drums include the Japanese taiko, the Chinese paigu, and the Korean buk. These drums often hold cultural significance and may be used for ceremonial, celebratory, or entertainment purposes in various settings, such as festivals, religious events, or cultural performances.\n\nIn summary, oriental musical groups focus on traditional instruments and styles from Asia, with drums being a common feature in their performances. The specific role and type of drums used in a performance depend on the region's culture and musical tradition, but they generally contribute to the rhythmic foundation of the music."

They are standing in a clearing with a festive and engaging atmosphere. \n\nThere are a total of ten people in the group, with some looking up, possibly at kites flying above them as two kites are visible in the sky. A few people are holding their belongings nearby, with a backpack and a handbag spotted on the grass.\n\nIn the background, there are two trucks and a bus parked, indicating that they might have arrived at the field in those vehicles. The scene appears to be taking place at a park, with people enjoying each other's company and engaging in various activities."

The ensemble consists of three adults and a child, each engrossed in their respective instruments.\n\nOn the left, a musician wearing a vibrant red hat is rhythmically beating a drum. Adjacent to him, another artist echoes the rhythm on a similar drum. Their hands move in a dance of their own, striking the drum surface with practiced ease.\n\nTo their right, another musician is blowing into a trumpet, adding a melodious layer to the rhythmic drum beats. The metallic trumpet gleams under the sunlight, its music resonating across the field.\n\nIn front of this trio, a child sits on the grassy ground. Despite his tender age, he too is part of this musical journey, his small hands skillfully playing another drum.\n\nIn the distance behind this captivating scene, a white van is parked, perhaps carrying more instruments or equipment for this musical group. Beyond it, a serene body of water stretches out, its calm surface reflecting the clear sky above.\n\nThis image captures not just a moment, but an entire story of music and tradition unfolding in an idyllic setting."
