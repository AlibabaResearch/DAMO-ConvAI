            "question": "Ana plays with $n \\times n$ boards by placing a token in each of the cells with no common points with other cells containing tokens. In the picture beside we see how to place as many chips as possible on $5 \\times 5$ and $6 \\times 6$ boards. In this way, how many chips can Ana possibly put on a $2020 \\times 2020$ board? Choices: ['2020', '4039', '$674^{2}$', '$1010^{2}$', '$2020^{2}$']",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The optimal way to place as many chips as possible on a $2020 \\times 2020$ board, as demonstrated for smaller boards in the image, is to arrange them in a checkerboard pattern. This method ensures that no two chips share any side or corner. Given the side length of the board (2020), the maximum number of chips that can be placed is $1010^2$, which is half the total number of squares, alternating between occupied and empty. Thus, the correct answer is '$1010^2', corresponding to Option D."

            "question": "Can you explain why the checkerboard pattern is the most efficient for placing the chips?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The checkerboard pattern is the most efficient way to place chips because it maximizes the number of chips while maintaining the condition that no two chips are adjacent either by side or corner. By alternating between a chip and an empty space both horizontally and vertically, every chip's direct neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) are empty spaces, which is the optimal arrangement under the given constraints."

            "question": "What would happen if a different pattern, such as placing tokens in every third square, was used on these boards?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Using a pattern where tokens are placed in every third square would significantly reduce the number of tokens on the board compared to the checkerboard pattern. The reduction occurs because the distance between placed tokens would be greater, leading to more unoccupied cells that do not meet the maximum potential of the board's capacity. Thus, fewer tokens would be placed, making this strategy less efficient for maximizing the number of tokens on the board."
