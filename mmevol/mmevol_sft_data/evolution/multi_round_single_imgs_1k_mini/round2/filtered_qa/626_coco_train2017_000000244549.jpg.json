Additionally, the people may inadvertently move closer to the vehicles while focusing on their kites, increasing the risk of accidents or injuries. To mitigate these risks, the individuals should be cautious about their surroundings and maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles, ensuring a fun and safe kite-flying experience for everyone."
