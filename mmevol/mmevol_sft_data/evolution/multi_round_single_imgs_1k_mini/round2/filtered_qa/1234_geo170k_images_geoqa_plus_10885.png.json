            "question": "As shown in the diagram, line a is parallel to line b, and angle 1 is 130 degrees. Therefore, angle 2 is equal to ().",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the diagram provided, lines a and b are parallel, and angle 1 measures 130 degrees. When two lines are parallel and intersected by a third line, alternate interior angles are congruent. Calculating the supplementary angle of 130 degrees (180 - 130) gives us 50 degrees. Since angle 3 lies between lines a and c and measures 50 degrees, angle 2, which lies between lines b and c in a corresponding position, must also be 50 degrees. Hence, the correct answer to the question is C: 50 degrees."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Parallel lines and angle measurements are fundamental in numerous real-world applications, ranging from architecture and engineering to navigation and graphic design. For instance, in architecture, understanding parallel lines and corresponding angles helps in ensuring buildings are structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing. In road design, parallel lines are used to ensure lanes are properly aligned which, along with accurate angle measurements, helps improve safety and traffic flow."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Supplementary angles, which add up to 180 degrees, are a core concept in geometry important for understanding the relationships between angles formed by intersecting lines, such as transversal cuts across parallel lines. This understanding is crucial for proofs, constructing geometric shapes, solving for unknown angles, and more. For example, they help in calculating the interior angles of polygons and are instrumental in various construction and design contexts, ensuring precision and alignment."
