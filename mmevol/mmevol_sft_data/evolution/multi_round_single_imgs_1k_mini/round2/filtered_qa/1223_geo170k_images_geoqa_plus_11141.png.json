            "question": "As shown in the diagram, the angle of corner B in a curved pipe ABCD is 75\u00b0. If pipe AB is parallel to CD, the angle of corner C is ()",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "When examining the diagram, the key observation is that the segments AB and CD are parallel. In geometry, when dealing with parallel lines and a transversal, the consecutive interior angles add up to 180\u00b0. Given that the angle at corner B is specified as 75\u00b0, we know that the angle at corner C must be 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0 to satisfy this rule. Thus, the angle at corner C is 105\u00b0. Hence, the answer is A: 105\u00b0."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Accurate angle measurements are crucial in pipe installation to ensure proper flow and avoid stress on the pipe system that could lead to leaks or bursts. For example, incorrect angles can disrupt water flow and increase pressure unexpectedly at certain points, thereby risking damages and compromising safety. A well-calculated angle, as seen in the diagram, ensures a smooth transition and efficient flow, ultimately contributing to the longevity and sustainability of the system. It is also essential for ensuring that substances being transported inside the pipes do not accumulate or stagnate, which could lead to hygiene concerns or inefficient processing."

            "question": "How might the principles of geometry help in optimizing the design of pipeline systems shown in the image?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Geometry plays a pivotal role in optimizing pipeline design by allowing engineers to calculate exact angles and dimensions needed to maximize efficiency and reduce materials use. In the context of the shown image, using geometric principles to determine the correct angles, such as the 105\u00b0 angle at corner C ensuring parallel alignment with other sections, helps in maintaining a consistent flow rate and reduces pressure losses. Moreover, effectively utilizing geometry in design minimizes waste by ensuring that pipes fit precisely together, reducing the need for extra joints or adjustments. This meticulous design process not only improves the operational efficacy but also enhances the environmental sustainability of pipeline infrastructure."
