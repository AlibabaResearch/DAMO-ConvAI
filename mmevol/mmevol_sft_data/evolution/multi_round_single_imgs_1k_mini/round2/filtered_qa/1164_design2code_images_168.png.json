            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To construct this website from scratch with HTML and CSS, follow these steps: \n1. **Create the HTML Structure**: Start by defining the basic structure of the webpage using HTML tags, setting up the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, and including the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements. Inside the `<head>`, include `<title>`, `<meta>` tags for SEO and charset, and link your stylesheet with a `<link>` tag.\n2. **Design the Layout**: Create a `<div>` with an id `#main` for the main content container. Inside it, add sections for headers, navigation, content, and footers using `<div>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` tags respectively.\n3. **Style with CSS**: Use an external CSS file to style your elements. As shown in the provided example, define body styles (background, font, margins), and styles for navigation, content, and other specific elements.\n4. **Implement JavaScript (if needed)**: If dynamic functionalities like text sizing are required, add JavaScript code inside `<script>` tags in the `<head>` or linked as an external script.\n5. **Optimize for Accessibility and SEO**: Ensure all images have `alt` attributes, use semantic HTML5 tags, and make your website mobile-responsive using media queries in CSS.\n6. **Testing and Debugging**: Test your website on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and fix any issues identified.\nFollowing these steps will allow you to build and style a website similar to the one in the example provided."
