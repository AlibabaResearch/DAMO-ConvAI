To prevent disturbing the birds or creating a potential conflict or harm, it is recommended to keep a safe distance from them and not approach them too close. Additionally, maintain cleanliness and hygiene around the water feature by not feeding the birds or littering, as it may attract more birds and create an unfavorable environment for other visitors."

The fountain is encased in a sturdy stone wall, topped with a black metal railing that adds a touch of elegance. \n\nPerched on the right side of this stone wall are two ducks, seemingly enjoying the serene environment. The male mallard, distinguished by his vibrant green head and brown body, stands next to his counterpart, a female mallard. She sports a brown body with a speckled head, providing a beautiful contrast to her mate's colorful plumage.\n\nThe park is nestled amidst urban structures, with buildings looming in the background. A street lamp stands sentinel nearby, ready to bathe the park in a warm glow as dusk falls. The lush trees surrounding the fountain add a touch of nature to this urban setting, creating a harmonious blend of city life and natural beauty."
