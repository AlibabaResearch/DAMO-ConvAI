A glimpse of additional storage areas for utensils or ingredients is also visible."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "From the image, we can note several safety measures standard to commercial kitchens. The staff are wearing aprons and protective clothing to shield against spills and burns. Non-slip footwear is likely being worn to prevent slipping on wet or oily surfaces, although this is not visible in the photo. The placement of the fire extinguisher near the entrance is a safety protocol for quick access in case of emergency. The organized arrangement of tools and clean workspaces also contribute to overall safety and efficiency."

            "question": "How does collaboration occur in such a setting?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Collaboration in the dynamic environment of a commercial kitchen, as depicted in the image, is key to the successful preparation and execution of meals. Each team member typically has a specific role or station they are responsible for, yet they must communicate clearly and work in harmony with others to ensure timely and high-quality food service. This coordination often involves calling out orders, timing dishes to be ready simultaneously, and maintaining a clean and orderly workspace to avoid cross-contamination or errors."
