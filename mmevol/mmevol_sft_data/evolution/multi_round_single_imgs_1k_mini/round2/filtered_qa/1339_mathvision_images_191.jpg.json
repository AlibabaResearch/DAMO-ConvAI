            "question": "In a church there is a rose window as in the figure, where the letters R, G and B represent glass of red colour, green colour and blue colour, respectively. Knowing that $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of green glass have been used, how many $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ of blue glass are necessary?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To determine the area of blue glass needed, we first observe the arrangement of colored glass pieces in the rose window. We know that the areas of green (G), red (R), and blue (B) glass pieces are equal since they occupy similar shaped regions in the window. Given that the area occupied by green glass is 400 cm\u00b2, the regions of red and blue glass individually must also contain 400 cm\u00b2 each. Therefore, the required area of blue glass is 400 cm\u00b2."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In many cultural and religious contexts, colors hold significant meanings.

The harmonious interplay of these colors in the window may thus represent a spiritual narrative of life, faith, and divine presence."
