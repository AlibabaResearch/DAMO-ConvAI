            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Format is fundamental because it governs the ability of a digital asset to be used effectively. Without a strong format, a digital asset is merely an undifferentiated string of bits. Having a known format ensures that the information can be interpreted and rendered properly, maintaining the asset's integrity and usability over time."

            "answer": "Sure! A museum archives digital copies of its rare manuscripts and artwork to make them accessible to a global audience. Over time, technology changes and the original digital formats may become obsolete. Through digital curation, the museum ensures these digital copies are converted to up-to-date formats, preserving their accessibility and usability for researchers, students, and art enthusiasts in the future."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Imagine a situation where an interstellar spaceship on its way to a distant planet carries digital blueprints for all essential systems. Halfway through the journey, the spaceship encounters a severe data corruption incident caused by cosmic radiation, putting the mission at risk. Thanks to advanced digital curation techniques, the spaceship's digital assets are quickly restored from encrypted backup formats, ensuring the crew can repair the systems and safely continue their mission."

            "question": "How do file formats affect the longevity of digital data?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "File formats are critical to the longevity of digital data. A well-documented and widely supported format is more likely to be accessible and functional over extended periods. Properly chosen file formats enable easier migration to new technologies without loss of information, ensuring that the data remains usable and meaningful despite changes in software, hardware, and standards over time."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "If file formats are not properly managed, digital assets risk becoming unusable. This could happen through technological obsolescence, where the software needed to read the formats is no longer available, or through data degradation and corruption. Without proper management, valuable information can be lost, leading to a loss of cultural heritage, scientific data, and important records."
