Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns could affect water quality and availability, leading to increased occurrences of kidney diseases. Additionally, increased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution could contribute to a higher prevalence of health conditions that affect the kidneys. Public health strategies would need to consider these potential impacts to effectively address the rising trends in nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis-related deaths."
