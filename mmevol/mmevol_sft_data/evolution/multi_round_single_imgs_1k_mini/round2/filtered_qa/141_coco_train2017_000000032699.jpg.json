Navigating different appliances and countertops might require additional time and effort, especially if the cook needs to go back and forth between different areas of the kitchen. Additionally, the counter space may be cluttered with items like cups, bowls, bananas, books, and bottles, leaving limited room for the cook to prepare ingredients or place dishes, so organization and tidying up would be essential to make the cooking process more efficient. Since there are numerous cookbooks visible in the kitchen, finding a specific recipe may also take time, and a more systematic organization of these resources may be helpful in locating the desired recipe more easily. Lastly, managing cooking times might be a challenge, so a cook should ensure they pay attention to the wall clock while preparing dishes to prevent overcooking or undercooking."
