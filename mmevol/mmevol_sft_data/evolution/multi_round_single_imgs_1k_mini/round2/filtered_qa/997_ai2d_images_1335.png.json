            "answer": "Erosion occurs at stage 'L' in the diagram. This stage shows soil and rock particles being worn away from the land, which is a critical part of the geological cycle affecting landscapes and rock formations."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "After erosion, the particles that are carried away by natural forces such as water or wind are eventually deposited. This is shown at stage 'M' in the diagram, where we see the accumulation of these particles forming newer layers or sediments."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the rock cycle on Earth's surface. It illustrates various geological processes like weathering, erosion, deposition, compaction, metamorphism, melting, and solidification. These processes highlight how rock material is continuously cycled through different forms and structures, driven by the Earth's internal and external forces."
