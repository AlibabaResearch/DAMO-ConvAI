            "question": "The image features a simple, two-tiered wooden table or stand, with a clear emphasis on minimalist design. The table consists of a light-colored wood, possibly birch or a similar pale wood, with a smooth finish. It has four vertical legs supporting two horizontal shelves: the top shelf forms the table surface, while the lower shelf is positioned midway between the base and the top. Each shelf has a raised edge, suggesting a tray-like design that could help contain items placed on it. There are no visible fasteners or hardware, contributing to the table's sleek appearance. The background is plain and white, which accentuates the table's natural wood color and simple lines. There are no texts or additional elements visible in the image. The style of the image is that of a product photograph, likely intended for a catalog or online store, with a focus on presenting the item clearly and without any distractions.",
