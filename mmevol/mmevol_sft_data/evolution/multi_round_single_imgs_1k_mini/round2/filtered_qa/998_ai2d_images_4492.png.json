            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The illustration labeled 'ALTERNATE' depicts the leaf arrangement where individual leaves are spaced alternately along the stem. This arrangement allows each leaf optimal access to sunlight and minimizes shading of the others."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! In the image, the 'COMPOUND' label indicates a type of leaf consisting of multiple leaflets joined to a single stem. It's a common adaptation that can help in reducing wind resistance or assisting in the efficient collection of sunlight."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The term 'simple' here refers to a leaf that is one continuous piece without separate leaflets, as depicted by the leaf under the label 'SIMPLE'. It's a basic yet diverse form of leaf that can be found in many shapes and sizes across various plant species."

            "question": "Is there a benefit to the 'basal rosette' arrangement?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Yes, the 'basal rosette' arrangement, shown with the leafy plant at the base, allows for a compact form where leaves grow at the base of the plant close to the ground. This can help protect the plant from herbivory and cold weather, and it can also support rapid vegetative growth."

            "question": "How do opposite leaf arrangements impact plant growth?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Opposite leaf arrangements, where pairs of leaves grow directly across from each other on the stem, can offer balance and allow for efficient space utilization on the stem. This can promote a symmetrical growth pattern which might help in the plant capturing sunlight evenly."
