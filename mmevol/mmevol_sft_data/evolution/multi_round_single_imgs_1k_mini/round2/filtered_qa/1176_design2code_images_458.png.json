            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Assembling a website like this one using HTML involves several key steps: First, we start with a basic structure using the HTML5 doctype declaration to ensure our page adheres to modern standards. Then, we define the basic structure with the <html> tag, specifying the language attribute. The <head> section contains metadata, including the character set, viewport settings, and links to stylesheets and other external resources. Within the <head>, we define CSS for styling. The <body> section encapsulates the visible content and structure of the webpage. This section includes a header with navigation positioned inside <nav> tags containing links to important parts of the site. The main content is structured with <main> and <div> tags, organized using CSS classes. Additional sections like <header>, <footer>, and <aside> are used for supplementary content. JavaScript can be included via <script> tags either in the <head> or before the closing <body> tag for added functionality."
