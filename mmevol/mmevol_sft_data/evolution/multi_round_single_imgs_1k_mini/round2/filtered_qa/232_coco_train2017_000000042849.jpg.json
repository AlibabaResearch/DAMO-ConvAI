The cars are parked on the sand, and there is a risk that the kites or their strings could get entangled with the vehicles or cause damage to them. Additionally, the proximity of cars could also pose a safety hazard for the kite flyers, as they might need to dodge around the vehicles or avoid collisions while running to launch or control their kites. This situation demands that the participants exercise caution while engaging in kite flying activities in this crowded parking area."

Despite these groups, the beach appears relatively empty with plenty of space between them.\n\nIn the foreground, two birds can be seen on the sand, adding to the natural beauty of the scene. Their presence suggests a peaceful coexistence between humans and wildlife in this picturesque setting. \n\nOverall, this image paints a picture of a leisurely day at the beach, filled with kite-flying, car gatherings, and bird-watching."
