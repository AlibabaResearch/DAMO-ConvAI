            "steps": [],
            "answer": "While this type of interaction might seem fun and exciting, there are some safety concerns that should be addressed:\n\n1. Risk of injury: Giraffes are large animals with strong necks and jaws. Although they are generally gentle, there is still a risk of accidental injury, like getting head-butted or bitten, especially when feeding them directly from the mouth.\n\n2. Disease transmission: The close interaction between human and giraffe could potentially lead to the spread of diseases or infections. Both humans and animals can carry bacteria or viruses that may cause illness.\n\n3. Animal welfare: Feeding a giraffe directly from the mouth may not only put the person at risk, but it can also inadvertently harm the animal, especially if the feeding is not done properly or if the food provided is not suitable for the giraffe's diet. Stress from handling or inappropriate feeding can negatively impact the animal's health.\n\n4. Encouraging unnatural behavior: Feeding animals in this manner can encourage them to become reliant on humans for food, potentially losing their natural foraging skills. It can also lead to increased aggression in some animals as they become more accustomed to close interactions with humans.\n\nTo ensure the safety of both humans and animals, it is essential to follow the guidelines and recommendations provided by the zoo or wildlife sanctuary. Staffed feeding stations where giraffes are used to being fed by humans and where the visitors are given guidance on how to feed the giraffes properly might be a safer and more appropriate way to interact with these animals without compromising their health or well-being."

            "question": "What risks are associated with this type of feeding interaction at the zoo?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Feeding a giraffe a carrot directly from one's mouth, as shown in this image, poses several risks for both the woman and the giraffe. For the woman, there is a possibility of accidental injury from the giraffe's teeth or sudden head movement. Additionally, there is a risk of transmitting or contracting pathogens due to direct contact with the animal's saliva. For the giraffe, there is a risk of receiving improper nutrition if visitors are allowed to feed them inappropriate food items. Human-caused food contamination is also a concern, posing potential health risks for the animal. This type of feeding interaction should be strongly discouraged to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of the animals and the people making such contacts. Zoos should provide appropriate guidelines on how visitors can interact safely with the animals, prioritizing the welfare of both parties."

It reaches out to a young girl who is offering it a carrot. The girl, dressed in a black hoodie, has her eyes closed, perhaps in anticipation or awe of the moment. Her hand is extended towards the giraffe, holding the carrot that the giraffe is about to eat.\n\nA little further back, another girl can be seen. She's wearing a white shirt and red pants, observing the interaction between her companion and the giraffe. The background is filled with trees and bushes, painting a serene setting for this beautiful interaction between humans and wildlife."
