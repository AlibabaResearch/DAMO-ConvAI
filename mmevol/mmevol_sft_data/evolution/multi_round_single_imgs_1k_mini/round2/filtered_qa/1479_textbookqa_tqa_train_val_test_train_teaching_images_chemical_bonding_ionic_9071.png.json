            "answer": "This diagram shows the ionic bonds in lithium fluoride molecule. An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. The lithium fluorine molecule consists of one lithium atom and one fluorine atom with the chemical formula of LiF. The lithium ion has one more protons than the number of electron thus has the charge of +1. The fluorine ion has one more electron than the number of protons thus has the charge of -1. The lithium ion and fluorine ion have equal but opposite charges so they attract each other. By the attracting force, they form a lithium fluoride molecule."
