            "answer": "While the exact sizes are not known, relative to each other, the blue cube appears to be the largest object, followed by the green cylinder, then the red cylinder, and the smallest is the cyan cup. Without a reference object for scale, precise measurements can't be provided."

            "answer": "The blue cube could serve as a makeshift stool or a large storage container given its size. The green cylinder might be a decorative piece or a container, while the red cylinder could be a smaller storage or desk organizing item. Lastly, the cyan cup, given its size and shape, would be suitable for holding pens or small office supplies."
