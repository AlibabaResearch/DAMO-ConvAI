            "answer": "In this figure, you see a Series and a Parallel circuit. The circuits are composed of one battery, two lamps and wires. The battery provides the required voltage for these circuits, and the wire is used to conduct the electricity between different components of the circuit. The Series circuit is shown on the left and the Parallel circuit is shown on the right. There is only one loop in the Series circuit, while the Parallel circuit has two loops. The lamps in the Series circuit will be turned off if one of the circuit components get disconnected. However, one of the lamps in the Parallel circuit will remain on even if the other lamp is disconnected."
