            "answer": "In Figure b, the expression 'n=Acos(\f03c6)' illustrates an important relationship in the context of the depicted phenomenon. Here, 'n' represents a value that is determined by the product of a certain constant 'A,' which can be interpreted as the amplitude, and the cosine of the angle '\f03c6'. This relationship implies that 'n' oscillates about zero, with its maximum deviation from zero being 'A', and it varies according to the cosine function of '\f03c6'. Since the question asks us to determine how 'n' is mathematically related to '\f03c6', the accurate answer is option C: n is a constant multiplied by the cosine of \f03c6. Understanding this relationship helps in grasping the basics of oscillatory motion depicted in the graph, where 'n' represents a measurable variable dependent on the angular displacement '\f03c6'."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The graph in part b of the image illustrates a potential energy landscape, visualized as a series of wells or dips. Each well represents a stable state, and the particles (depicted as blue circles) can oscillate between these states. This graphical representation corresponds to the experimental setup described in part a, where a physical system, potentially involving optical elements and tracking via DAQ and FPGA, controls and measures the dynamics of these particles within similar potentials. Essentially, part b provides a theoretical model explaining the underlying physics explored in the experimental setup of part a."

            "answer": "From the setup depicted in Figure a, we can infer that the DAQ (Data Acquisition) system is likely designed to handle high-resolution measurement and real-time data processing, key for capturing the rapid dynamics of the phenomena being studied. However, limitations might include the precision with which it can handle fluctuations or very minor changes in the state, as heavily dependent on the calibration of the DAQ and the sensitivity of the sensors used, such as the PD (Photodiode)."
