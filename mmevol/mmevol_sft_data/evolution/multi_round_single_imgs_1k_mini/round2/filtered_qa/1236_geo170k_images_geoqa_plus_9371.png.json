            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To find the length of side BC in the parallelogram ABCD, we analyze the properties of the shape in conjunction with the given measurements. Since DE is perpendicular to AB and equals 40 units, and angle A is 30 degrees, the triangle formed by AD, DE, and AE is a 30-60-90 triangle. This specific ratio in such triangles provides that the length of the hypotenuse (AD, which equals BC due to the properties of parallelograms) is twice the length of the shorter leg (DE). Therefore, BC measures 80 units. Answer: A"

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "A parallelogram is a four-sided figure where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Additionally, in parallelograms, opposite angles are also equal. Another important property is that the diagonals bisect each other, which contributes to the symmetry of this shape. This specific geometry can be useful in various mathematical and real-world applications, providing balance and consistency."

            "question": "How would the shape of figure ABCD change if angle A was changed to 60 degrees but all other dimensions remained the same?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "If angle A were changed to 60 degrees while retaining the same side lengths, the overall shape of parallelogram ABCD would adjust to maintain the properties of a parallelogram. Specifically, angles C would also become 60 degrees because they are opposite to angle A. Correspondingly, angles B and D would adjust to 120 degrees each. This alteration would cause the parallelogram to appear more 'stretched' or elongated compared to its original configuration. The side lengths would remain constant, but the visual appearance of angle alignments would make the shape look different."
