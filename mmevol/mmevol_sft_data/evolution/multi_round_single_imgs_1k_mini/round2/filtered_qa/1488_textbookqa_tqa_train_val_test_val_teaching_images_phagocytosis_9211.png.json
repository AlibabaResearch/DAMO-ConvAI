            "answer": "This diagram shows the process called Phagocytosis. Through this process, our defense system fights bacteria and destroys them keeping them out of our system. An amoeba is a type of cell or organism which has the ability to alter its shape, primarily by extending and retracting pseudopods. Once the white blood cells detect any inflammation, they go to where damaged tissue is located and eat pathogens and dead cells by engulfing and destroying them. In order to do this, bacteria is digested and nutrients are absorbed and the waste products are expulsed out by the amoeba."
