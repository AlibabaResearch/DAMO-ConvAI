Following closely is the second elephant with a person holding a flag aloft, fluttering gently in the breeze. Bringing up the rear is the third elephant, its rider holding a spear, standing tall and proud. The lush green grass underfoot and the trees scattered around provide a serene backdrop to this spectacle, while distant buildings hint at civilization not too far away.
