A wire is run from the positive side of a battery then coil around the nail then to the negative side of the battery. As electric current flows through the wire, magnetic field is produced around the coil of wire with the electric current. The coil of wire with electric current flowing through it is called a solenoid. The more turns the coil has, the strong the electromagnetic field will be."
