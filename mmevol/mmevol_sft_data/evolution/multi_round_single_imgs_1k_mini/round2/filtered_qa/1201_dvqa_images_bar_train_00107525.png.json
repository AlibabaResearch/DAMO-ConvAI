'Edge' and 'wonder' have a moderate preference with 4 and 3 people respectively. 'Look' is less preferred with 2, and 'patent' has the lowest preference with only 1 person choosing it. This indicates a diverse set of interests, with one object being highly favored and another significantly less so."
