            "question": "In the diagram, triangle $J K L$ is isosceles with $J K=J L, P Q$ is perpendicular to $J K$, angle $K P L$ is $120^{\\circ}$ and angle $J K P$ is $50^{\\circ}$. What is the size of angle $P K L$ ?  Choices: ['$5^{\\\\circ}$', '$10^{\\\\circ}$', '$15^{\\\\circ}$', '$20^{\\\\circ}$', '$25^{\\\\circ}$']",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "First, we need to find the measure of angle $P K L$ in the isosceles triangle $J K L$. Given that $J K = J L$, $P Q$ is perpendicular to $J K$, and $K P L = 120^{\\circ}$, we know that angle $J K L$ is divided into parts by line $P Q$. Since $J K P = 50^{\\circ}$, and considering that the sum of angles in a triangle is always $180^{\\circ}$, we can calculate angle $K P J$. Since angle $K P L = 120^{\\circ}$, angle $K P J$ will be $180^{\\circ} - 120^{\\circ} = 60^{\\circ}$. Now, adding angles $J K P$ (50^{\\circ}) and $K P J$ (60^{\\circ}), we find the remaining angle, $P K L$, which must make up the sum to 180\u00b0. Thus, $P K L = 180^{\\circ} - (50^{\\circ} + 60^{\\circ}) = 70^{\\circ}$. However, there is a typo in the choices provided, as none of the listed options match this answer."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the triangle $JKL$, the triangle is isosceles with $JK = JL$. This symmetry indicates that angles $JLK$ and $JKL$ are congruent. Since $P Q$ is perpendicular to $JK$, it forms right angles with $JK$. Angle $KPL$ is given to be $120^{\\circ}$, and angle $JKP$ is $50^{\\circ}$. The angles in triangle $KPL$ need to add up to $180^{\\circ}$. Since $JKP$ is $50^{\\circ}$ and $KPL$ is $120^{\\circ}$, we need the angle $PKL$ to find the solutions."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! To determine angle $PKL$, we need to consider the total angles around point $P$ and within the triangle $KPL$. Given $KPL$ is $120^{\\circ}$ and $JKP$ is $50^{\\circ}$, the remaining angle to make up the triangle $KPL$ should be $180^{\\circ} - (50^{\\circ} + 120^{\\circ}) = 10^{\\circ}$. Thus, $PKL$ = $10^{\\circ}$."

            "answer": "In a distant geometrical kingdom, the triangle $JKL$ stood as the Guardian of Symmetry. The sides $JK$ and $JL$ represented the perfect balance, ensuring harmony in the land. One day, a magical line, $PQ$, descended to enforce the rule of right angles, declaring that no imbalance should disrupt the peace. Angles $KPL$ and $JKP$, revered as the ancient protectors, held knowledge of the sacred $120^{\\circ}$ and $50^{\\circ}$ decrees. The kingdom thrived, knowing their united strength created the angle $PKL$, the symbol of unity and order."

            "answer": "If angle $KPL$ were changed to $90^{\\circ}$, the properties of triangle $JKL$ would significantly alter. $KPQ$ would no longer form a straight line and would break the $120^{\\circ}$ equilibrium. This alteration would reduce the sum of angles to comply with the triangle theorem, remodeling the geometric relationships and reclaiming balance."

            "question": "Considering the triangle $JKL$, how would you approach finding all the internal and external angles?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To systematically find all internal and external angles of triangle $JKL$, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Given Angles and Relationships: Note that $JKL$ is isosceles with $JK = JL$, and $PQ$ is perpendicular to $JK$. Given angles like $JKP = 50^{\\circ}$ and $KPL = 120^{\\circ}$ are crucial starting points.\n\n2. Calculate Unknown Angles: Use the angle-sum property in triangle $KPL$. With $KPL = 120^{\\circ}$ and $JKP = 50^{\\circ}$, find $PKL$: $PKL = 180^{\\circ} - (120^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ}) = 10^{\\circ}$.\n\n3. Verify External Angles: External angles are supplementary to their corresponding internal angles. For example, external angle at $K$ would be $180^{\\circ} - 120^{\\circ} = 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nCombining these steps ensures accurate determination of all internal and external angles within the triangle $JKL$."

            "answer": "Long ago, in the celestial sphere, there existed a mighty warrior named Jax, symbolized in the sky as the triangle $JKL$. Jax wielded the sacred sword $JL$ and the mystical shield $JK$. The sacred council decreed that $PQ$, the Beam of Balance, must always be perpendicular to $JK$, to maintain harmony in the heavens. But one fateful night, the Evil Serpent $KPL$ broke free and unleashed chaos with its $120^{\\circ}$ venomous fangs. The Wise Sage $JKP$, knowledgeable of ancient spells, cast a $50^{\\circ}$ defense charm. Together, they forged the angle $PKL$ of $10^{\\circ$, sealing the serpent and restoring balance to the celestial order. From that day, the $JKL$ constellation glows brightly, reminding all of Jax\u2019s bravery and the eternal battle between order and chaos."
