Accidents during such stunts can lead to severe injuries or even death. Several precautions should be taken to minimize the risks and ensure the safety of both the stunt riders and any spectators watching the event.\n\n1. Professional supervision and guidance: Such stunts should only be attempted under the supervision of experienced riders or stunt professionals who can provide guidance, assess the rider's skills, and ensure all necessary safety measures are in place.\n\n2. Proper training: Stunt riders should undergo extensive training and practice to develop and refine their skills, control, and timing in performing such stunts.\n\n3. Use of adequate safety gear: It is crucial for the rider to wear appropriate safety gear, such as helmets, gloves, protective padding, and riding boots that can absorb impact and prevent injuries in case of accidents.\n\n4. Proper setup of the stunt location: Ensure that the stunt area is well-suited for the jump, with a smooth, level surface for take-off and landing, and enough clearance for both height and distance. Check and maintain the integrity of the parked vehicles, making sure they are stable and secure.\n\n5. Regular maintenance and inspection of the motorcycle: The motorcycle being used for the stunt should be in top condition, regularly inspected for any potential issues, and serviced as necessary.\n\n6. Exclusion of unauthorized individuals or vehicles: Keep unauthorized people and vehicles away from the stunt zone to prevent accidents and unnecessary distractions.\n\nIn conclusion, while motorcycle stunts like jumping over parked cars can be dangerous, taking appropriate precautions and following recommended safety measures can help minimize risks and ensure the safety of the riders and spectators. Moreover, it should be attempted only by skilled and experienced riders under professional supervision."
