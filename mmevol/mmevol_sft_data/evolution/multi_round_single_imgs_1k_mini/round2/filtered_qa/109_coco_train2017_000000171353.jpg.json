            "steps": [],
            "answer": "A professional kitchen, such as one found in a restaurant, typically has several key features that distinguish it from a home kitchen. Some of these features include:\n\n1. Large, commercial-grade appliances: Professional kitchens are usually equipped with sturdier, more powerful appliances than those found in a home kitchen. This could include commercial ovens, stovetops, and refrigerators, designed to handle heavy usage and a larger volume of food.\n\n2. Stainless steel surfaces: Professional kitchens often use stainless steel for countertops, shelves, and sinks, as it is easy to clean, durable, and resistant to bacteria and corrosion.\n\n3. Ample storage and organization: Chefs in a professional kitchen work with a wide variety of ingredients and tools, so having organized storage and shelving for items like cooking utensils, pots and pans, and dry goods is crucial.\n\n4. Specialized cooking equipment: In addition to standard appliances, professional kitchens typically have specialized equipment for specific cooking tasks, like walk-in refrigerators and freezers, deep fryers, or sous vide immersion circulators.\n\n5. Safety and sanitation measures: Commercial kitchens must adhere to strict safety and sanitation guidelines, which may include designated hand-washing stations, non-slip flooring, and proper food storage practices to prevent cross-contamination and ensure food safety.\n\nThese are just a few features that could be found in a professional kitchen. However, it is worth noting that some well-equipped home kitchens may also incorporate some of these elements for convenience and efficiency."

The shelf is organized into three rows, each lined with bottles of different shapes and sizes, their contents reflecting a spectrum of colors. \n\nTo the side of the counter, a cash register waits patiently for its next transaction. The backdrop is a gray wall adorned with a large mirror, adding depth to the space and reflecting the lively atmosphere of the bar. The scene is a snapshot of a typical night in the life of this bartender, surrounded by the tools of his trade and immersed in his craft."
