Each type of apple has its own label, allowing visitors to identify them by name. The colors of the apples range from bright reds to sunny yellows and deep greens, painting a beautiful palette of autumn hues.\n\nBehind the table stand two people, presumably the sellers, ready to share their knowledge about the different apple varieties. In front of the table, a little girl stands in awe, her eyes wide with curiosity as she takes in the array of apples before her.\n\nIn the background, other booths can be seen, each offering their own unique products, contributing to the lively atmosphere of the farmer's market. The scene is a testament to the richness and diversity of local produce."
