            "steps": [],
            "answer": "There could be several reasons for the grass being dry:\n\n1. Seasonal changes: Dry grass could be a result of the natural seasonal changes in the region, such as during the dry season or late summer when rainfall is limited, and vegetation becomes parched.\n\n2. Drought: Extended periods of little or no rainfall can cause the grass to dry out, reducing its nutritional value for grazing animals like zebras.\n\n3. Overgrazing: When herds of grazing animals, such as zebras or other herbivores, consume too much of the available plant life in an area, it may not have enough time to regrow properly, leading to a less lush and drier appearance.\n\nIn the context of the image with the zebra, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the dry grass without more information about the location and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, dry grass is a common natural occurrence, and grazing animals like zebras can still find sustenance in it as they are well-adapted to their habitats."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the image, the zebra is seen grazing on dry tall grass, which indicates that the zebra might be facing challenges related to food availability in its habitat. During dry seasons or in arid environments, the vegetation tends to be less nutritious due to the lack of moisture and reduced plant growth. This can result in a scarcity of fresh, green, and nutrient-rich grass, forcing the zebra to rely on lower-quality dry brush for sustenance. As a result, the zebra needs to spend more time and energy grazing to meet its nutritional needs, which can also make it susceptible to predation and other environmental challenges. In order to thrive in such conditions, zebras have adapted by developing strong and efficient digestive systems that allow them to extract nutrients from lower-quality food sources like dry grass."
