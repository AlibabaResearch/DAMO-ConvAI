This nutrient enrichment promotes healthy grass growth, benefitting deer. However, when we consider the presence of a lion, we recognize a shift in population dynamics. The lion's predatory pressure could lead to a decline in the deer population, which means less dung is produced. Consequently, the dung beetle has less food available, possibly resulting in fewer beetles over time. Thus, the balance of this ecosystem is delicate, where the roles of each species directly impact one another through multiple interactions.",
