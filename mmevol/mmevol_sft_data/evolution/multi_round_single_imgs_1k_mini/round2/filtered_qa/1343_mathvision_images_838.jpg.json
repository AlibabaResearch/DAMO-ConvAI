            "question": "Daniela fills a $3 \\times 3$ table using the digits 1 to 9 so that each field contains only one digit. She has already placed the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the table as shown in the diagram. Two numbers count as \"adjacent\" if the fields which they fill have one common side. When she has finished filling the table she realised: the sum of the numbers adjacent to 5 is 9. How big is the sum of the numbers adjacent to 6?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To determine the sum of the numbers adjacent to 6, we first need complete information on how Daniela fills the rest of the $3 \\times 3$ grid after placing numbers 1 to 4 as shown. Assuming a plausible configuration respecting all given constraints, including that the sum adjacent to 5 is 9, one such configuration needs to be logically deduced or provided. Without the ability to see the complete setup, a definitive sum adjacent to 6 cannot reasonably or accurately be calculated."

            "question": "Assuming Daniela placed the number 5 in the center of the $3 \\times 3$ grid with adjacent numbers summing to 9, what other creative patterns could she use to fill the table ensuring a unique solution?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Daniela could create symmetrical patterns, such as placing higher numbers opposite to lower numbers symmetrically around the center. For instance, placing 9 in the top right and increasing the number moving clockwise could present an interesting challenge to achieve the conditions for adjacent numbers."

            "question": "Which symmetrical pattern would also ensure that the sum adjacent to number 6 is unique and balanced?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "One symmetrical pattern could be placing 9 in the top right and decreasing progressively to 5 in the center, followed by increasingly lower numbers towards the bottom left. This pattern would ensure each number's adjacent sums vary distinctly, making the puzzle both challenging and unique."

            "question": "In a scenario where Daniela uses a mathematical pattern such as even and odd placement, how should the numbers be configured in the $3 \\times 3$ matrix?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Daniela could alternate even and odd numbers across rows and columns. For example, starting with an odd number like 1 in the top left, followed by an even number 2, and continuing to alternate. This setup ensures a balance among the numbers while also aligning with mathematic patterns that could be another layer of challenge."

            "format": "Norm",
            "question": "What if the matrix needs to reflect a Fibonacci sequence or similar growth pattern, where would each number go ideally?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In a Fibonacci-like sequence pattern, placement starts low and grows according to the sequence. Daniela could place 1 in the top left, another 1 next to it, then a 2, followed by a 3 beside the first 1, making growth apparent in both directions. Such arrangements bring an arithmetical beauty to her $3 \\times 3$ puzzle."
