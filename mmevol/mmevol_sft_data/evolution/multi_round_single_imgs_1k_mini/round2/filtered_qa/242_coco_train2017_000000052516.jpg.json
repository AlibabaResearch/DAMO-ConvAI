Furthermore, the presence of many people in the area could make it difficult to achieve the desired level of privacy or intimacy for their wedding photos. To overcome these challenges, the photographer may need to carefully choose angles and positions to capture the couple's special moments without being affected by the surrounding distractions."

Their locations vary - some closer to the couple, others further away, adding depth to the scene. Amidst the stationary and moving cars and a bus on the street, the couple and their carriage seem to be in a world of their own.\n\nTall and modern buildings rise in the background, their towering presence contrasting with the trees lining the sidewalk. The trees add a touch of nature to this urban setting. This image captures a special moment - a blend of love, tradition, and city life."
