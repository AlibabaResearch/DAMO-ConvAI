            "answer": "The diagram shows the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which carries the genetic information of organisms. DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. The four types of nucleotide correspond to the four nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three hydrogen bonds). During DNA replication, the parent DNA unwinds and each parental strand serves as a template for replication of new strands. Nucleobases are matched to synthesize the new daughter strands."
