            "answer": "In this rainy weather, pedestrians should take several precautions to ensure their safety and comfort. They should carry and use umbrellas, as seen in the image with one of the individuals holding one, to protect themselves from the rain. Beyond personal comfort, these individuals should also wear appropriate clothing, such as waterproof jackets and footwear, to stay dry and warm. Moreover, it is crucial to be aware of their surroundings, as wet sidewalks and roads can be slippery, increasing the risk of accidents. Pedestrians should exercise caution while crossing streets, watching for vehicles, and following traffic signals, as vehicular stopping distances might be impacted by wet road conditions. Additionally, they should maintain a safe distance from traffic, as passing vehicles may splash water onto them. By taking these precautions, pedestrians can safely navigate rainy city streets."
