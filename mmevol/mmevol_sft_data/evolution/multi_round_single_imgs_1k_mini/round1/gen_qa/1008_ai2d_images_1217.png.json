    "question": "What is the primary function of the Golgi apparatus as depicted in this cell diagram?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to modify, sort, and package proteins for secretion. It also plays a role in the transport of lipids around the cell and the creation of lysosomes."

    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "In what way does the large central vacuole support plant cell functions?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The large central vacuole supports plant cell functions by maintaining turgor pressure, which keeps the plant cell rigid. It also stores nutrients, waste products, and helps in the breakdown of complex molecules."

    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "How does the cell wall contribute to the structural integrity of this plant cell?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The cell wall provides structural integrity by giving the cell shape, protecting it from mechanical stress, and preventing over-expansion when water enters the cell."

    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "What is the significance of ribosomes on the rough ER in the cell?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "Ribosomes on the rough ER are crucial for protein synthesis. They manufacture proteins that are either incorporated into the cellâ€™s membrane or secreted from the cell."

    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "What are the potential consequences if the chloroplasts in this cell became non-functional?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "If chloroplasts became non-functional, the plant cell would lose its ability to perform photosynthesis, leading to a lack of glucose production and eventually causing the plant to die due to energy deficiency."

    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "Envision that the nucleus is a central command center. Describe what missions it might control inside the cell.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The nucleus, as the central command center, might control missions such as directing protein synthesis, regulating metabolism and cell growth, and overseeing cell division, ensuring all parts of the cell function harmoniously."

    "image_position": "single",
    "objects": [],
    "skills": [],
    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "Propose a scenario in which the cell requires enhanced activity from its endoplasmic reticulum.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "An enhanced activity of the endoplasmic reticulum might be required during periods of rapid cell growth or stress when increased protein and lipid synthesis is needed to support expanding functions and repair cellular components."

    "image_position": "single",
    "objects": [],
    "skills": [],
    "format": "Norm",
    "question": "Summarize the role of the cytoplasm in maintaining cell stability.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The cytoplasm acts as the medium in which organelles are suspended, facilitating movement of materials within the cell and contributing to the cell's structural stability by maintaining its shape and consistency."
