    "question": "What significant changes occur during the 'Alevin' stage in the salmon's life cycle?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "During the 'Alevin' stage, the young salmon has just hatched and is still attached to its yolk sac, which provides nutrition. This stage occurs within the gravel, and the alevin remains hidden to avoid predators. This period is crucial for developing basic structures and preparing for the 'Fry' stage when it will start feeding independently."

    "question": "Describe the transition from the 'Smolt' stage to 'Adult' in the salmon's life cycle as illustrated in the diagram.",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The transition from 'Smolt' to 'Adult' involves the salmon migrating from freshwater to the sea. During the 'Smolt' stage, the fish undergoes physiological transformations to survive in saltwater, such as changes in salt and water regulation. Upon reaching the ocean, the salmon grows rapidly, eventually reaching adulthood. As adults, they return to their natal rivers to spawn, completing the life cycle."

    "question": "What adaptations occur during the 'Egg' stage that ensure survival?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "During the 'Egg' stage, several adaptations occur to ensure survival, such as the development of a tough outer shell that protects against physical damage and predators. The eggs also rely on their environment, being laid in a gravel nest ('Redd'), where the flow of water provides oxygen necessary for development. The location and covering contribute to camouflaging the eggs from predators."

    "question": "How does the salmon's behavior change during the 'Smolt' stage?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "During the 'Smolt' stage, salmon behavior changes dramatically as they prepare for ocean life. They become more silvery in appearance to blend into the open water and begin schooling for protection during migration. They also become more active during twilight and nighttime hours, aiding in predator evasion during this vulnerable period of transition from freshwater to marine environments."

    "question": "What factors influence salmon during the transition from 'Parr' to 'Smolt'?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The transition from 'Parr' to 'Smolt' is influenced by environmental cues such as light levels, water temperature, and flow. These cues trigger hormonal changes that facilitate physical and behavioral transformations necessary for marine life. The preparation for saltwater includes improving the efficiency of osmoregulation and changes in physical appearance to enhance survival during migration."
