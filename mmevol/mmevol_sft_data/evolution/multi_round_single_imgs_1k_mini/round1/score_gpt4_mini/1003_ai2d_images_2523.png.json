    {"improved": "yes", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten sample adds a multiple-choice format, increasing complexity slightly through more options."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten version asks for two reasons which prompts deeper analysis and explanation, thereby increasing semantic complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 3, "reason": "The revised question emphasizes the evaluation aspect, which implies a deeper understanding of the diagram's content."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 2, "reason": "The question remains similar in complexity, but the request for highlighting two key points adds marginal complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The addition of a multiple-choice aspect slightly improves the complexity by requiring distinguishing between various concepts."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The revised question not only asks for an explanation but also prompts validation against the provided image, adding significant depth to the inquiry."}
