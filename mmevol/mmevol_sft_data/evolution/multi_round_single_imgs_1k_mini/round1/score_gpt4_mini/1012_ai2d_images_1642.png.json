    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "While the rewritten sample introduces a lunar eclipse instead of a solar eclipse, it does not significantly improve upon the complexity or length compared to its original. The changes are superficial, limiting the improvement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten question shifts focus from solar to lunar eclipses but does not enhance the complexity or depth of the explanation. Similar patterns and phrasing diminish improvement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten answer captures the impact on nocturnal animals during a lunar eclipse but simplifies the original context. The semantic complexity does not surpass the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "This answer shifts to cultural beliefs without enhancing detail or complexity compared to the original samples on the topic of solar eclipses. Information remains at a similar level."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten question covers a historically significant lunar eclipse, but the content does not exceed the depth or richness found in the solar eclipse context in the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "While the hypothetical scenario regarding the Moon's mass is creative, it does not significantly exceed the complexity or detail compared to the original focus on solar eclipses."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Although this answer remains imaginative, similar reasoning applies; it suggests a lunar civilization's purpose without increasing overall complexity over original nuanced discussions."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The response to how scientists use lunar eclipses maintains similar scientific understanding with little shift in depth or complexity compared to the original studies of solar eclipses."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The experience of lunar eclipses is depicted as social and educational, similar to the original but does not expand upon the complexity established in detailing solar eclipse experiences."}
