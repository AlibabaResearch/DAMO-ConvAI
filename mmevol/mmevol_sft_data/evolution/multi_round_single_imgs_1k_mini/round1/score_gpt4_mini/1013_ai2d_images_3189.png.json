        "reason": "The rewritten sample has significantly increased complexity by not only detailing the role of the bud in reproduction but also considering the implications of its removal on the plant and its ecology. This creates a multi-layered question that requires deeper analysis."

        "improved": "yes",
        "score": 7,
        "reason": "This version explores the consequences of compromising the growing point more extensively, leading to higher semantic complexity in understanding its role and potential adaptations, making it more engaging and thought-provoking."

        "improved": "yes",
        "score": 6,
        "reason": "The revised question emphasizes the interaction between lateral roots and main roots while also considering the implications of disruption in this synergy, which adds depth and necessitates a more complex answer compared to the original."
