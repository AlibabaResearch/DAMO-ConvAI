    {"improved": "no", "score": 2, "reason": "The rewritten sample simplifies the question and removes the complexity of context related to the keychain, resulting in minimal increase in length and detail."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "While it aims to describe the room, it strips back some detailed context about the surroundings, maintaining a similar complexity as the original."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "The original scenario asked for creative elaboration, while the rewritten version restricts it to three rationales and loses narrative flow, which reduces engagement."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The task is simplified to listing four features, which, while maintaining some complexity, does not match the original's richer descriptive expectations."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "Although it attempts a short story format, the rewritten answer lacks the depth and vivid description present in the original, lowering the overall complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 3, "reason": "This multiple-choice question format enhances engagement through decision-making, though it retains a lower complexity compared to the original."}
