    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "The rewritten sample is slightly more organized but lacks depth and complexity compared to the original. There is only a minor increase in semantic complexity."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "Although this rewrite has some structure, it simplifies the original intentions. The semantic complexity is slightly enhanced, but overall detail is reduced."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 4, "reason": "While there is a slight improvement in clarity, the overall richness of the content has diminished, providing less detail regarding the possible contents of the hidden drawer."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "There is a modest increase in clarity and organization, but the semantic and visual complexity is lower than the original, resulting in a less immersive experience."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "This rewrite is structured well, but it fails to capture the complexity and depth of the scenario. It simplifies the elements considerably."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "Although the rewrite presents the idea clearly, it loses the original's potential for complexity and scenario depth, reducing the richness of the magical context."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 6, "reason": "Although the rewritten version is succinct, it does not capture the complexity of the original investigation scenario well enough, resulting in lower complexity overall."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewrite simplifies the approach and removes some nuance present in the original, making it less engaging in terms of exploration and discernment."},
    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "This variation maintains some structure but reduces the richness and complexity found in the original narrative regarding the interaction with the map."}
