            "answer": "The current amount will be further reduced for Marlboro, Camel, and Winston brands. Specifically, the price reduction offers $3.50 per carton and 55 cents per pack, with an additional $2.50 per carton or 25 cents per pack off the existing Buy-Down amount. This offer relates to a broader change in the 'Cigarette Buy-Down Program.', and excludes Virginia Slims which will be discontinued from this program."
