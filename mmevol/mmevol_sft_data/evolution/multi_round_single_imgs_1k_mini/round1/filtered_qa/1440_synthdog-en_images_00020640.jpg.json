Several options have been suggested for a CP-140M replacement. These include the Boeing P-8 Poseidon and the Raytheon Sentinel, based on the Bombardier Global Express. Plans are to downsize the fleet from 18 to 14 aircraft, with three already being withdrawn and a fourth as a test aircraft to be retired in the near future. A solar storm is a disturbance on the Sun, which can emanate outward across the heliosphere, affecting the entire Solar System, including Earth and its magnetosphere, and is the cause of space weather in the short-term with long-term patterns comprising, space climate. Solar storms include: Grindelwald is a village and m'"

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The Boeing P-8 Poseidon and the Raytheon Sentinel are both advanced surveillance aircraft. The P-8 Poseidon, primarily used by the US Navy, is designed for maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare. The Raytheon Sentinel, based on the Bombardier Global Express platform, is used for ground surveillance, capable of high-altitude, long-endurance operations. Their mention suggests these aircraft are being considered as replacements in the fleet, likely due to their cutting-edge technology and versatility in surveillance and reconnaissance missions."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "A solar storm involves disturbances on the Sun, like solar flares or coronal mass ejections, which release vast amounts of energy and matter. These phenomena can traverse space and impact Earth's magnetosphere, leading to geomagnetic storms. Effects on Earth include disruptions to communication and navigation systems, power outages, and increases in radiation risks for astronauts and high-altitude flights. They also can cause beautiful natural displays like the auroras (northern and southern lights)."
