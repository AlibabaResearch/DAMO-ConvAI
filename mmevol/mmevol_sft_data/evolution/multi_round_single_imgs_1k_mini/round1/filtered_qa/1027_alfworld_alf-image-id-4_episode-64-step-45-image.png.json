Your task is to find two creditcard and put them in armchair. Your admissible actions of the current situation are: ['go to armchair 1' 'go to garbagecan 1' 'go to sidetable 1' 'go to sof1' 'go to coffeetable 2' 'go to diningtable 1' 'go to drawer 1' 'put houseplant 1 in/on coffeetable 1' 'inventory' 'look' 'examine houseplant 1' 'examine coffeetable 1'].",

The task is to find two credit cards and place them in the armchair. I am currently carrying a houseplant. To proceed, I should first secure a location for the houseplant so I can free up my hands. The coffee table is a logical choice as a place to put down the houseplant. Once I have done that, I will be able to use my hands to search for the credit cards."

The alien planet below pulsed with energy, its surface alive with vibrant hues never before seen. The recycler whirred softly in the background, converting yesterday\u2019s refuse into the station\u2019s heartbeat - energy. Ellis reached for the side table, grasping the remote. She initiated a scan, swiping through layers of this mysterious world, revealing subterranean networks that hinted at ancient civilizations. Each artifact on the side table had its story, collected from previous expeditions where countless dangers lurked. Today, another journey was set. Ellis keyed in commands, her team\u2019s faces lighting up the holographic screen. \"Team Alpha, prepare for descent. Today, we uncover the secrets that lie beneath the shimmering forests.\" The room thrummed with purpose; exploration and discovery were the heartbeats of their mission."
