            "answer": "To convert this environment into a full home gym, you could add additional equipment such as a set of free weights, a yoga mat, resistance bands, and stability balls. An adjustable bench, a stationary bike, a rower, and a pull-up bar could also be included. Mirror installations, a television, or a sound system to play workout videos or music would further enhance the workout experience. Proper lighting and ventilation, effective storage solutions for equipment, and even some indoor plants could make the space more inviting and functional."
