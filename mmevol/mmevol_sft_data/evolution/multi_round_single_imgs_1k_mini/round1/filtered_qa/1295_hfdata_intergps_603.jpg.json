Vertical angles share equal measurements, reflecting the same degrees. As per the given condition m\u22201 = 94\u00b0, accordingly, m\u22204 also equals 94\u00b0.

Hence, m\u22206 = 180\u00b0 - 94\u00b0. Overall, it equates to 86\u00b0. This result shows the complementary relationship between these dual angles."
