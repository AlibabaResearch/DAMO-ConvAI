Building a strong in-ring persona requires psychological readiness to stay in character and engage the audience effectively. Pre-match rituals, such as listening to music or meditation, help in calming nerves and channeling energy.

            "answer": "To safely execute high-risk moves, wrestlers undergo extensive training to perfect their techniques and ensure precise execution. They learn to distribute impacts safely, using muscles and soft areas to absorb shock instead of joints and bones. Communication with opponents is imperative, ensuring both parties are aware and prepared for the maneuver. Utilizing protective gear and a well-padded ring surface minimizes injury risks. Regular rehearsals, including stunt coordination with experienced trainers, help in mastering these moves while maintaining the theatrical aspect of wrestling. Adherence to safety protocols and continuous skill development are essential for minimizing injuries and enhancing performance."
