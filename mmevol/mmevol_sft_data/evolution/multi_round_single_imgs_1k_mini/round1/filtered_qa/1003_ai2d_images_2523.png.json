For instance, the Summer Solstice is on June 21st, signaling the longest day, while the Winter Solstice on December 21st marks the shortest day. The equinoxes in March and September represent times of equal day and night, important for understanding Earth's seasonal cycles."

Conversely, the Winter Solstice brings about winter with minimal daylight and cooler temperatures. The equinoxes transition the seasons, bringing either spring or fall as the Earth orbits the Sun."
