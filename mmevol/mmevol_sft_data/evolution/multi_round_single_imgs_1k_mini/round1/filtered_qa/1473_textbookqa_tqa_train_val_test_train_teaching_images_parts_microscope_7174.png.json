            "answer": "The diagram shows the anatomy of a microscope. There are two optical systems in a compound microscope: The Ocular Lens and the Objective Lens. Eyepiece or Ocular is what you look through at the top of the microscope. Eyepiece Tube holds the eyepieces in place above the objective lens. Objective Lenses are the primary optical lenses on a microscope. They range from 4x-100x and typically, include, three, four or five on lens on most microscopes. Objectives can be forward or rear-facing. Nosepiece houses the objectives. The objectives are exposed and are mounted on a rotating turret so that different objectives can be conveniently selected. Coarse and Fine Focus knobs are used to focus the microscope. Stage is where the specimen to be viewed is placed. Stage Clips are used when there is no mechanical stage. Aperture is the hole in the stage through which the base (transmitted) light reaches the stage. Illuminator is the light source for a microscope, typically located in the base of the microscope. Condenser is used to collect and focus the light from the illuminator on to the specimen. Iris Diaphragm controls the amount of light reaching the specimen. It is located above the condenser and below the stage. Condenser Focus Knob moves the condenser up or down to control the lighting focus on the specimen."
