These areas are crucial as they provide the moisture needed for their skin and respiration. Throughout their life cycle, this preference remains strong, as moist conditions are essential for survival and reproduction. Habitat loss or drying can disrupt these conditions, impacting their ability to thrive. Therefore, understanding their preferences highlights the importance of conserving these environments to support their life stages.",

During metamorphosis, they undergo significant changes: losing their gills, developing lungs or adapting their skin for terrestrial breathing, and growing larger with fully developed legs. Adults thus appear more robust, adapted for land, and capable of reproduction. This transitional phase marks a crucial shift in habitat and behavior, reflecting their adaptability and evolutionary success.",
