Her red bag, full of unseen essentials, sits next to her.\n\nThe compartment itself is bathed in artificial light, casting a warm glow on the scene. A window to the left offers a fleeting glimpse of another train, painted in bold yellow, as it speeds past. The two passengers, despite their physical proximity, are worlds apart, each immersed in their own tasks. Yet they share this moment in time, two strangers on parallel journeys."
