            "answer": "A picnic table is a type of outdoor furniture specifically designed for eating meals outside. It usually consists of a flat table surface connected to one or more benches on either side, providing seating for people. The table and benches are typically made of wood, metal, or a combination of these materials. They are often designed to be sturdy and low-maintenance, since they are primarily used outdoors and exposed to various weather conditions.\n\nThe style of a picnic table can vary, but many are rectangular or hexagonal in shape, allowing for easy access to the seating and promoting social interaction among diners. Some picnic tables are designed with a central hole to accommodate an umbrella, providing shade and protection from the sun or rain. Picnic tables can be found in various public spaces such as parks, campgrounds, and scenic locations, as well as in private backyard settings. They offer a casual, relaxed atmosphere for dining and socializing with family and friends."
