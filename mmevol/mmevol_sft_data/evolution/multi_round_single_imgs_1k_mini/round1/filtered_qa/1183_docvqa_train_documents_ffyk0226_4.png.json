            "answer": "The growth box was placed in a cold room, maintained at a temperature of approximately 10 degrees Celsius, as part of a controlled environment setup to study plant responses under specific temperature and light conditions."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the growth box diagram, component 1 is the growth box itself where the plants are placed; component 2 consists of lamp bulbs providing necessary lighting; component 3 is a heater for temperature regulation; component 4 is a thermostat to maintain the desired temperature; component 5 is a fan transducer for air distribution; component 6 appears to be a displacement meter for measuring growth; component 7 is a mercury switch; component 8, the program controller, likely manages the operational settings of all these components; and component 9 is a recorder, documenting all data related to plant growth and environmental conditions."

            "question": "How was the temperature inside the growth box regulated during the experiments?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The temperature inside the growth box was regulated using a combination of a heater and a thermostat, as mentioned in the diagram. The temperature was set to lower progressively to mimic natural conditions, with heaters possibly activating to maintain minimal temperature levels and ensure that it did not fall below the threshold necessary for the plant's growth."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Figure 2 shows a graph representing the automatic control of air temperature inside the growth box. The time-course of the temperature during the experiments demonstrates fluctuations within a permissible range, aligning with programmed plant growth rates and temperature settings. It effectively illustrates how the growth environment was adapted over time to suit the developmental stages of the plant, ensuring optimal growth conditions through monitored and adjusted settings."
