Utilizing an external monitor to increase the display area and allow more efficient collaboration with better visibility of the content being discussed.\n2. Using a larger table to ensure everyone has a comfortable space to sit and work comfortably, which can prevent fatigue and improve focus during the collaborative session.\n3. Equipping their workspace with relevant stationery and resources, like notepads and pens, if not already present, to easily take notes, jot down ideas or sketch while discussing.\n4. Keeping the workspace clutter-free by removing unnecessary objects, like handbags and backpacks, so that the area remains organized and less distracting.\n5. Implementing time management strategies, such as setting specific goals or utilizing a timer, to keep the meeting focused and efficient. \n\nThese suggestions can help the participants feel more organized, focused, and comfortable, facilitating better collaboration and ultimately resulting in increased productivity."

In the center, another individual leans over the laptop, their interest piqued by what they see. On the right, a third person points at the screen, perhaps highlighting a crucial point or leading the discussion.\n\nThe kitchen around them is adorned with various utensils hanging on the wall, each telling a story of meals prepared and shared. A large pot rests on the counter, hinting at a meal that was recently cooked or is about to be started. The scene is a blend of work and home life, a testament to collaboration and camaraderie in an everyday setting."
