            "question": "The input for this task is an image of commonly encountered office objects such as keyboards, file cabinets, and laptops from three different categories(AMAZON, DSLR, WEBCAM). The output of this task is to name the domains of the image(AMAZON, DSLR, or WEBCAM). AMAZON: These images were captured from a website of online merchants, they are captured against a clean background. DSLR cameras offer improved image quality when compared to standard webcams.\nOptions: (a) amazon (b) webcam (c) dslr",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Based on the characteristics observed in the image, the domain is likely to be (b) webcam. The rationale for this classification is founded on the image quality and context observed. The image does not feature the clean white background typical for Amazon product photos, which often include shadows or reflections to highlight dimensions. Additionally, the image lacks the sharpness, depth of field, and high-resolution details that are hallmarks of DSLR photography. Instead, the image possesses qualities associated with a standard webcam, such as casual documentation with lower detail and resolution."
