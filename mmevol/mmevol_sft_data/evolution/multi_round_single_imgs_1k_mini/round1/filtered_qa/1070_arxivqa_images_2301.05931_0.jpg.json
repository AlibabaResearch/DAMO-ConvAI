            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the self-training strategy depicted in the figure, the combination of 'Training' and 'Predicting' steps creates 'Pseudo-Labeled Data'. This data is derived from the initial training on labeled data, followed by the application of the trained model to predict labels for unlabeled data. These predictions, termed as pseudo-labels, help in augmenting the original dataset, playing a critical role in the iterative process of model improvement and refining prediction capabilities."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The pre-trained models, as depicted in the figure, provide a foundational layer for graph construction by utilizing various sources such as drug interactions, gene expression data, and protein information. They contribute node features like gene expression from ESM-1b or interactions from KGPT, which are essential for building the initial graph framework where entities like drugs, diseases, and proteins/gene are interconnected. These detailed node features are crucial for accurately defining the relationships and attributes within the graph."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the depicted flow, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) play a vital role after the initial graph is constructed. They are used to refine the graph by learning and optimizing the embeddings of nodes based on the graph's topology and the node features. This refining process helps in enhancing the predictive quality and the structural integrity of the graph, leading to a more accurate and context-aware embedding representation, as shown in the 'Refined Graph Structure A*' part of the diagram."

            "question": "What implications do the 'Synergistic' and 'Antagonistic' optimizations have on the final results?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The 'Synergistic' and 'Antagonistic' optimizations in the MLP prediction model are essentially strategies to fine-tune the interaction predictions between drugs and diseases. A synergistic effect implies that the combination of the drugs is more effective than their individual effects separately, whereas an antagonistic effect suggests that the drugs counteract each other. Understanding these interactions allows for the development of more effective treatment methods and can significantly influence the effectiveness of the drug combinations proposed by the model."
