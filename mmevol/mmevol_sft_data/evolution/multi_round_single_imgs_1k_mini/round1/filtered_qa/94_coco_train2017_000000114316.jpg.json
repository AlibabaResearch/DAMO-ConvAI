She's pouring water into a pot that's waiting on the stove, ready to bubble and steam. The stove, part of a white oven, is nestled between a white fridge on its right and a white sink on its left, all three standing like sentinels against the kitchen's yellow-tiled walls.\n\nThe floor, tiled in pristine white, reflects the soft light in the room. A white microwave and coffee maker share space on the counter, silent companions in the woman's culinary journey. An unexpected guest in this culinary space is a sleek white iMac, stationed next to the sink. It stands out against the traditional kitchen appliances, hinting at a blend of technology and tradition in this warm kitchen scene."
