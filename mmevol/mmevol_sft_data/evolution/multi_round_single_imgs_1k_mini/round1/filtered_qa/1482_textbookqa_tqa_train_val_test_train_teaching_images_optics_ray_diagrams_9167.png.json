            "answer": "This diagram shows Ray (optics). In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. This allows even very complex optical systems to be analyzed mathematically or simulated by computer. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray (sometimes known as the b ray) in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. As such, chief rays are equivalent to the rays in a pinhole camera. The Central Ray is perpendicular to Infrared Radiation. The third one, called the Focal Ray, is a mirror image of the parallel ray. The focal ray is drawn from the tip of the object through (or towards) the focal point, reflecting off the mirror parallel to the principal axis."
