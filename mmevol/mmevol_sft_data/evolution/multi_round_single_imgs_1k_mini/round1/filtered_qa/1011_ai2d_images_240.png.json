            "answer": "In the image, the deer feeds on grass primarily, but other elements pictured might symbolically suggest different forms of consumption or interaction with soil and plant life, like the dung beetle indirectly relying on grass through its interaction with dung, part of a larger ecological cycle."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The dung beetle, shown rolling a dung ball, participates in a nutrient recycling cycle. It collects and eats dung, which is partly digested plant matter including grass. Through this process, nutrients are returned to the soil, promoting plant growth and completing an ecological cycle."

            "answer": "In their natural habitats, the presence of a predator such as a lion significantly influences the behavior of prey animals like deer. Deer must be constantly vigilant and often alter their feeding and movement patterns to avoid predation. This predator-prey relationship is essential for maintaining ecological balance."
