Protective clothing: Wear UV-protective clothing and wide-brimmed hats to shield skin from the sun. This can help reduce the risk of sunburn and long-term skin damage.\n\n4. Sunglasses: Wear sunglasses with full UV protection to protect the eyes from harmful UV rays and reduce the risk of cataracts and other eye-related conditions.\n\n5. Hydration: Drink sufficient water and stay hydrated throughout the day to prevent dehydration due to sun exposure and heat.\n\n6. Heat stroke prevention: Take regular breaks to cool off, avoid excessive physical activities during peak sun hours, and pay attention to any signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\nBy following these precautions, beachgoers can have a safer and more enjoyable time at the beach while minimizing risks associated with sun exposure."
