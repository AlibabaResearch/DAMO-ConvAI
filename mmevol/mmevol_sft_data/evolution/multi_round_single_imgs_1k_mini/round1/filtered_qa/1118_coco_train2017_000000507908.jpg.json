            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The correct option is B. giraffes. In the image, you can observe several giraffes with their distinct long necks and patterned coats, which are characteristics unique to them. These majestic animals are all gathered near a fence within what appears to be a natural habitat enclosure, likely in a zoo setting."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The giraffes are in an environment that mimics the savannas where they naturally live. This fenced area likely provides them with trees for shade and browse, as well as sufficient space to walk around. It's designed to simulate their natural habitat, ensuring their well-being while living in a zoo."

            "answer": "Yes, there are indications of human presence and interaction. For example, the fencing is a clear sign of human management, and the structure visible on the left suggests that keepers have access to the area to provide care and feeding for the giraffes. Such settings often include enrichment activities to keep the animals engaged and healthy."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Giraffes are social creatures, and in this image, we see a small group gathered together, which is common in their behavior. They often form loosely associated groups, particularly visible in a controlled setting like this, where they might mingle or eat together. Their coexistence in a shared space reflects some aspects of their natural social interactions."
