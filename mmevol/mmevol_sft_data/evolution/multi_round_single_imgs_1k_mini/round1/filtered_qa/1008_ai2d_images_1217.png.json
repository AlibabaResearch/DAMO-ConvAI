            "answer": "A realistic scenario where a plant cell might expand its vacuole is during times of water abundance. The vacuole would take in extra water, increasing in size. This helps maintain turgor pressure, which keeps the plant rigid and upright. It also stores excess nutrients and waste products, playing a critical role in the cell's homeostasis."
