The Subarctic region consists of Boreal forest. The Temperate region consists of Temperate forest, Grassland, Chapparal, and Desert. The Tropical region consists of Tropical forest, Grassland, and Desert. The temperature and the dryness of a place decide its region. As the temperature increases, there is a change in the different regions. The hottest and driest region is the Desert. The coldest and the driest region is the Tundra. The coldest and the least dry region is the Tropical forest."
