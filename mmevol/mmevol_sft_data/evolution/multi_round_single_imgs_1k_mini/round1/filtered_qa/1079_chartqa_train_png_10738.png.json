            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The pie chart indicates that a significant majority of Germans (57%) in 2015 preferred stronger ties with the U.S. compared to only 15% who preferred stronger ties with Russia. Additionally, 21% felt that having equally strong ties with both was important, showing a clear preference for maintaining a closer relationship with Western powers."

This suggests that a small but notable fraction of the population was either undecided or possibly less engaged with the issue of alignment in foreign relations."
