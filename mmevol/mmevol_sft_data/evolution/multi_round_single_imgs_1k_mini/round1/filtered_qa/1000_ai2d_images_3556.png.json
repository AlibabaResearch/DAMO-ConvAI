It comprises the outer ear, which captures sound waves; the middle ear, where these waves are converted into vibrations; and the inner ear, where these vibrations are transformed into nerve signals that the brain interprets as sound."

            "answer": "Besides smelling, the nose also plays a crucial role in breathing. It filters, moistens, and warms the air we breathe, helping to protect the respiratory system. Additionally, the nose contributes to the taste of food by enabling the sense of smell, which is closely linked to taste perception."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The ear not only facilitates hearing but also plays a pivotal role in maintaining balance. The inner ear contains the vestibular system, which includes semicircular canals filled with fluid and tiny hairs. As we move, the fluid inside these canals shifts, causing the hairs to bend and send nerve signals to the brain about the body's orientation and motion. This helps us keep our balance and coordination."

These structures work together to transmit sounds to the inner ear efficiently, supporting the ear's primary functions of hearing and balance."
