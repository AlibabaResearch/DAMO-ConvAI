            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the context of skateboarding, a halfpipe is a U-shaped ramp structure used for performing various tricks and maneuvers. It comprises two vertical ramps, or transitions, facing each other with a flat bottom in between. Skateboarders move back and forth between the two ramps, gaining momentum and speed to perform aerial tricks and flips when they reach the top edge, which is also known as the lip or coping. Halfpipes are commonly found in skate parks and are popular structures for both skateboarding competitions and casual practice."

A black helmet ensures his safety as he defies gravity, his skateboard obediently following beneath him.\n\nOn the ground below, a handful of spectators have gathered, their eyes glued to the spectacle unfolding before them. Their positions vary, some standing closer to the ramp while others maintain a safe distance, but all are united in their anticipation of the skateboarder's landing.\n\nThe park itself is alive with nature. Trees stand tall in the background, their leaves a lush green canopy under the open sky. Nestled among them is a building, its details obscured by distance and foliage.\n\nEvery element in this image - from the airborne skateboarder to the captivated audience and the serene park setting - combines to create a dynamic snapshot of an exhilarating moment."
