These tourists are likely participating in a safari tour, which allows them to see the giraffes up close and learn more about their behavior and habitat. As a result, the giraffe encounters humans and vehicles within the sanctuary without feeling threatened or disturbed, and the visitors get to observe and appreciate the giraffe in a safe and controlled environment."

Its long neck is gracefully arched downwards, allowing it to feast on a lush bush. The giraffe's location is such that it appears to be a stone's throw away from a beige safari vehicle that is traversing a dirt road on the right side of the image.\n\nThe safari vehicle is filled with tourists, each donning hats and sunglasses, possibly to shield themselves from the tropical sun. They seem to be engrossed in the sight of the giraffe, their gazes fixed on the tall creature. The vehicle's journey on the dirt road has kicked up a small cloud of dust behind it, adding a sense of motion to the scene.\n\nThe backdrop of the image is adorned with towering palm trees, their fronds swaying gently in the breeze. The trees add a tropical charm to the scene, enhancing the overall safari experience depicted in the image. The entire scene paints a vivid picture of an exciting safari adventure in progress."
