The pamphlet, which is from Amtrak, features a green and white illustration of a train and a city skyline. The text on it reads \"National Train Day, May 11, 2013, A Deal That Matters, Amtrak\".\n\nIn the background, there's a vibrant red and orange train engine with a white stripe. The words \"Santa Fe\" are written on the side of the engine. The train is on a track surrounded by trees under a clear blue sky. The contrast between the pamphlet in the foreground and the train in the background creates an interesting depth to the image."
