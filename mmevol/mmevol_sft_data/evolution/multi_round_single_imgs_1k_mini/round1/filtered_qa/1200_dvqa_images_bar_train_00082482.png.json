This suggests that colorful items are more popular among consumers compared to plain ones."

The difference in units sold \u2014 8 for 'color' versus about 5 for 'plain' \u2014 indicates a trend where items with color are more popular and likely to be purchased."

These could include the price point, marketing efforts, availability, the season when the data was collected, and individual product features that resonate with consumer needs or trends."
