            "question": "Around the outside of a $4$ by $4$ square, construct four semicircles with the four sides of the square as their diameters. Another square, $ABCD$, has its sides parallel to the corresponding sides of the original square, and each side of $ABCD$ is tangent to one of the semicircles. What is the area of the square $ABCD$?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To find the area of the square $ABCD$, we need to derive the side length of $ABCD$ by understanding its relationship with the semicircles. Since each side of $ABCD$ is tangent to a semicircle, we can set up the relationship in terms of geometry and solve for the side length. However, without an exact solution provided in the answer, we can't specify the area here."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To calculate the side length of the inner square $ABCD$, we need to use the radius of the semicircles which is half the side of the outer square. Let's denote the side length of the outer square as $s$. The radius of the semicircles is thus $s/2$. The side length of $ABCD$ can be expressed in terms of $s$ and the radius of the semicircles, and using geometrical properties, we can then find an expression for the area of $ABCD$ in terms of $s$."

            "question": "Could you elaborate on the relationship between the side length of $ABCD$ and the radius of the semicircles?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly, if we focus on one of the corners of the larger square, we will see that the distance from the tangent point on one side of the inner square $ABCD$ to the corner of the larger square is the radius of the semicircle. The same is true for the perpendicular distance on the adjacent side. If the side length of the larger square is $s$, then $ABCD$ will be a square with four equal sides of length $s - 2*(s/2)^2$ due to the Pythagorean theorem. Simplifying this, we find the side length of $ABCD$ is $s * (\u221a2 - 1)$. Squaring this gives us the area of $ABCD$."

            "question": "What happens to the area of the inner square $ABCD$ if the size of the outer square changes?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The area of the inner square $ABCD$ is functionally dependent on the size of the outer square. Since the side length of $ABCD$ is calculated by the expression involving the side length of the outer square, $s * (\u221a2 - 1)$, it follows that any change in the size of the outer square will be reflected in the area of $ABCD$. Specifically, as the size of the outer square increases or decreases, the area of $ABCD$ will increase or decrease proportionally to the square of the side length of the outer square."
