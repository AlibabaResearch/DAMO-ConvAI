            "answer": "The diagram represents the coastal Erosion of a headland. A headland is an area of hard rock which sticks out into the sea. Headlands form in areas of alternating hard and soft rock. Where the soft rock erodes, bays are formed on either side of the headland. As the headland becomes more exposed to the wind and waves the rate of its erosion increases. When headlands erode they create distinct features such as caves, arches, stacks and stumps. The sequence in the erosion of a headland is as follows: 1. Waves attack a weakness in the headland. 2. A cave is formed. 3. Eventually the cave erodes through the headland to form an arch. 4. The roof of the arch collapses leaving a column of rock called a stack. 5. The stack collapses leaving a stump."
