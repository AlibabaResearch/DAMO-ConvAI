            "answer": "The GRU, which stands for Gated Recurrent Unit, is typically used to integrate information over time. In the context of the figure, the GRU is part of the fusion module, which suggests that it is used to integrate the output of the C2P Attention with prior features, thus incorporating temporal information to refine the prediction for \\( p^t \\). Therefore, the correct answer is C."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) in the diagram plays a crucial role within the fusion module by integrating temporal information. This makes it key in managing the sequence of features over time. Essentially, the GRU receives the output from the C2P (Camera to Plan) Attention module, which processes positional embeddings and BEV (Bird's Eye View) features, and then refines these inputs to produce updated predictive features. This temporal synthesis allows for more accurate and dynamic updates to the system's understanding, enhancing the overall decision-making process in applications like automated navigation systems."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the depicted system, the fusion module serves as a critical intermediary that bridges the local inference process and the global update mechanism. Initially, the encoder generates BEV features that are combined with prior features by local inference. The fusion module then uses these combined features, processes them through the C2P Attention and GRU to refine and update the features, which are finally sent to the global update. This process ensures a continuous and coherent integration of new sensory data and past information, optimizing the system's overall responsiveness and accuracy in real-time navigation tasks."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Positional embeddings in this architecture play a fundamental role in ensuring that the spatial relationships and orientation within the input data are preserved and appropriately utilized. Specifically, positional embeddings (PEc and PEp) are used within the fusion module to inform the C2P Attention mechanism about the relative positions of different features. This allows the system to maintain an understanding of where objects are located relative to each other in the BEV space, which is crucial for tasks that require spatial awareness, such as navigation and object tracking in autonomous vehicles."
