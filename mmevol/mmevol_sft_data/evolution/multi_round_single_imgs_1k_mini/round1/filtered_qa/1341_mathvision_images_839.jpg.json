            "answer": "The correct answer is shape B. In this shape, one half of the triangular figure is colored grey, with a clear division down the middle. This distinct division makes it easy to see that exactly 50% of the shape is grey, fitting the criteria of the question."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! In shape A, less than half of the circle is grey. Shape C is divided into four equal parts, each a quarter, so no half portion is grey. Shape D also has divisions, with each segment being less than half. Lastly, shape E shows multiple triangular segments with grey areas, but none constituting exactly half."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "If we divided the shapes horizontally, shape D would depict a perfect split. The square is divided by diagonal lines into four triangles of equal size, with opposing triangles colored grey. A horizontal division would evenly split these triangles, making half of the square grey and the other half white."
