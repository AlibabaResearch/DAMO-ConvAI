            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Fox hunting is a traditional equestrian sport that involves the pursuit of a fox by riders on horseback, accompanied by a pack of specially trained scent hounds, usually foxhounds. Fox hunting has been practiced for centuries in various parts of the world, particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States. It has evolved into a formal sport with a set of rules and etiquette to ensure the safety of participants, animals, and spectators.\n\nThe main objective of the sport is for the hounds to track and pursue the scent of the fox, and for the riders to follow the dogs across the countryside, over obstacles like fences and hedges, until the fox either escapes or is caught by the hounds. It is important to note that in some countries, notably the UK, the practice of hunting live foxes has been banned, and hunts now follow artificially laid scent trails instead.\n\nThe Master of Hounds plays a crucial role in the fox hunting process. This person is responsible for managing the pack of hounds, which includes training, caring, and breeding the dogs to ensure they are well-prepared for the hunt. The Master of Hounds is an experienced and knowledgeable individual who understands dog behavior, the intricacies of hunting, and the local terrain. Their main job is to ensure that the hounds follow the scent of the fox effectively and maintain discipline during the chase.\n\nDuring the hunt, the Master of Hounds leads the pack of dogs out onto the field, guides them in pursuit of the fox, and controls the hounds using voice commands or horn signals. They work closely with other key individuals in the hunting party, such as the huntsman, who typically rides with or just behind the hounds, and the whippers-in, who are responsible for keeping the hounds from straying too far from the scent trail.\n\nIn conclusion, fox hunting is an equestrian sport that has a rich history and a unique set of traditions, rules, and roles. The Master of Hounds is a central figure in the hunting process, tasked with managing and leading the dogs as they pursue the fox across the countryside."

Multiple umbrellas can be spotted throughout the scene, indicating that they are being used to keep both the participants and the viewers dry and more comfortable during the event. It's likely that rain gear, such as raincoats and waterproof boots, are also being worn by some people to minimize the impact of the wet conditions."

They seem to be under the guidance of the horseman, their movements suggesting a sense of direction.\n\nIn the distance, you can see an assortment of tents and vehicles, perhaps indicating a nearby camp or gathering. The trees stand tall against the horizon, adding depth to the landscape.\n\nAbove them all, the sky is painted with soft, cloudy strokes, casting a serene ambiance over the scene.
