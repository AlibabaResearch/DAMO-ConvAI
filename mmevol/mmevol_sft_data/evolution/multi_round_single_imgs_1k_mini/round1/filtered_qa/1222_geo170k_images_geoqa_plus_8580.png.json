            "question": "On circle O, point D is situated with AC as the diameter. If angle BDC equals 35.0, what is the degree of angle ACB?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Given that AC is the diameter of circle O, any angle subtending the diameter (such as angle ACB) is a right angle, hence 90 degrees. Now, since angle BDC, which also subtends to the point on the circle opposite the diameter, is given as 35 degrees, the remaining segment of angle ACB is calculated as 90 degrees minus 35 degrees, which is 55 degrees. Therefore, the degree of angle ACB is indeed 55 degrees. Answer: B."

            "answer": "Triangle OAB would be an isosceles triangle, given that the angles at O, angle OAB, and angle OBA, are equal. This implies that the sides OA and OB, which are radii of the circle, are also equal, as is characteristic of isosceles triangles."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "If point A is moved to point D, the segment AC (now segment DC since A and D have swapped places) will still be a diameter. Therefore, the angle BDC would still be a right angle, or 90 degrees, continuing to demonstrate the inscribed angle theorem where an angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The segments OA, OB, and OC are all radii of the circle, forming triangles OAB, OBC, and OCA. Each of these triangles is isosceles since two sides (the radii) are equal. Properties like area and internal angles of these triangles will vary based on the angle at the vertex of the circle, but each triangle will maintain symmetry due to the equal radii."
