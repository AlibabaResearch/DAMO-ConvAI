    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The rewritten sample adds complexity by explaining how the ear connects to the brain for sound interpretation, increasing both length and semantic depth."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rewritten sample enhances the explanation of the nose's functions with a detailed account of interactions with the respiratory system, increasing semantic complexity and adding depth to the answer."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 9, "reason": "The rewritten sample elaborates on the ear's vestibular system role in balance with detailed mechanics and integration with other body parts, significantly increasing complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rewritten sample expands on the collaboration of different ear parts and their roles in hearing and balance, providing detailed step-by-step information that enhances understanding."}
