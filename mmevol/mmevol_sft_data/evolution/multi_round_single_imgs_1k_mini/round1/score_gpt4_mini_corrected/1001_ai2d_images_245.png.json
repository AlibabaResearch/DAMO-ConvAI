    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten sample increases complexity by specifying 'energy flow' and detailing interactions between species, enhancing semantic depth."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The rewrite enhances the analysis of how a reduction in sea ice affects the entire food web, expanding on ecological interconnectivity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The new question introduces a nuance about dietary adaptability, slightly increasing complexity and the implication of interspecies dynamics."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten answer adds detail about shrimp's role in maintaining aquatic health while explaining their impact on algae, heightening complexity."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 8, "reason": "The rewrite elaborates on adaptive features for survival, providing specific adaptations and environmental interactions, greatly enhancing detail and complexity."}
