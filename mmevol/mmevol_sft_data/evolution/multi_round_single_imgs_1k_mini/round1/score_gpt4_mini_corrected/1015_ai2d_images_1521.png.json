    {"improved": "no", "score": 3, "reason": "While the rewritten sample is slightly more specific about the definition of 'n=1', it does not significantly increase the overall length or complexity compared to the original."},

    {"improved": "no", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten sample offers a deeper understanding of the relation between Planck's constant and frequency which adds some complexity, but it does not improve significantly over the original in terms of length or depth."}
