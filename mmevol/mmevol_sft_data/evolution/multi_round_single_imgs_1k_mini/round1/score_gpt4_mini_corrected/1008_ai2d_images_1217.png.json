    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten sample provides a more specific inquiry about the Golgi apparatus's function, increasing semantic complexity and introducing more detail than the original."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The rewritten version enhances detail and specificity regarding the vacuole's support of cell functions, improving clarity and completeness."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten question clearly states how the cell wall contributes to structural integrity, making it more specific than the original."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The revised question emphasizes the importance of ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis, enhancing both complexity and detail."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 6, "reason": "The rewritten version highlights the significant consequences of non-functional chloroplasts, providing a more nuanced understanding of their importance."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 7, "reason": "The envisioning of the nucleus as a command center expands on its functions and gives a more creative and complex visualization of cellular operations."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 5, "reason": "The proposed scenario makes the function of the endoplasmic reticulum more specific and relates it to dynamic cellular conditions, increasing context and depth."},
    {"improved": "yes", "score": 4, "reason": "The rewritten summary of the cytoplasm's role enhances clarity, focusing on specifics that contribute to stability."}
