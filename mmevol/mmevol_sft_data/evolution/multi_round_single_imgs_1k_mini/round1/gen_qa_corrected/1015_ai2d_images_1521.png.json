    "question": "What does the label 'n=1' signify in the diagram?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "'n=1' signifies the innermost electron energy level or shell in the diagram. This is the energy level closest to the nucleus, and it represents the lowest possible energy state for an electron within an atom as per quantum mechanics."

    "question": "What is the meaning of the transition shown between the 'n=2' and 'n=3' energy levels?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "The transition between the 'n=2' and 'n=3' energy levels demonstrates an electron moving to a higher energy state. This requires the absorption of energy, typically a photon, corresponding to the difference in energy between these two levels as indicated by the formula ΔE = hv."

    "question": "How do Planck's constant and frequency relate to the formula ΔE = hv in this diagram?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "In the formula ΔE = hv, Planck's constant 'h' and frequency 'v' relate to the energy change in electron transitions. The energy change 'ΔE' is the product of Planck's constant and the frequency of the photon involved in the transition. This represents the quantum mechanical principle that energy levels in atoms are quantized and require specific energy quanta for transitions."
