    ],
    "answer": "On a rainy day, standing by the sink, the kitchen feels cozy and inviting. The soft drumming of raindrops against the window adds a soothing soundtrack, while the overcast sky casts a gentle, diffused light throughout the room. The reflections on the sink seem more pronounced with the lack of direct sunlight, and there's a comforting sense of warmth inside compared to the chilly, wet weather outside. The kitchen takes on an atmosphere of quiet contemplation and warmth, perfect for brewing a hot drink and watching the rain."

    "answer": "During the mid-20th century, kitchen designs began to include more built-in appliances, like dishwashers and modernized ovens, reflecting the move towards convenience. Cabinets were often made from sleek materials like laminate, and color schemes became bolder with pastel hues popularized in that era. Open plan layouts started to gain popularity, contrasting with the more enclosed design seen here. These spaces were transformed to boost efficiency, aesthetics, and the domestic role of kitchens as living spaces."
