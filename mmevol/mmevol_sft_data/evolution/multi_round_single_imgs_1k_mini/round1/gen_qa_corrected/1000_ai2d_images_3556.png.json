As air passes through the nasal passages, it is moistened and warmed, which prevents irritation in the lungs. This filtering and conditioning of air protects the respiratory system from pathogens and enhances overall lung health. These integrated functions are crucial for effective breathing and respiratory protection."

The ossicles amplify and relay these vibrations to the cochlea in the inner ear, which sends signals to the brain for sound interpretation. Additionally, the vestibular system in the inner ear collaborates with these parts to maintain balance, showcasing the complex interaction required for hearing and equilibrium."
