      {"manipulation": "None", "description": "Explain how shedding enables the caterpillar to grow."}
    ],
    "answer": "The larva, or caterpillar, must shed its skin multiple times to accommodate its growing body. This process, known as molting, is essential for its development as it allows the caterpillar to increase in size. As the caterpillar consumes large amounts of food, its exoskeleton becomes too tight, and shedding enables it to form a new, larger skin."

      {"manipulation": "None", "description": "Describe the changes that occur inside the chrysalis during this stage."}
    ],
    "answer": "The pupa stage, also known as the chrysalis, is crucial for the transformation of a caterpillar into an adult butterfly. During this stage, the caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis, where its body is restructured to form the wings, antennae, and other parts of the mature butterfly. This stage is essentially a period of significant change and development, laying the groundwork for its emergence as an adult."

      {"manipulation": "None", "description": "Explain how these factors might influence growth rates and development times."}
    ],
    "answer": "Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity can significantly affect the duration and success of each stage in a butterfly's life cycle. Warmer temperatures generally speed up the development process, reducing the time spent in each stage. Conversely, cooler temperatures may lead to longer durations and even dormancy during adverse conditions. Humidity levels can also impact the hatching of eggs and the integrity of the chrysalis, potentially affecting survival rates."

      {"manipulation": "None", "description": "Discuss camouflage, toxins, and behavior as defensive strategies."}
    ],
    "answer": "Caterpillars have developed several adaptations to survive the vulnerable larval stage. Many species utilize camouflage to blend in with their surroundings, protecting them from predators. Some produce toxins or have spines that deter predators from eating them. Additionally, certain behaviors, such as group feeding or silk thread spinning, can offer extra protection and mobility."
