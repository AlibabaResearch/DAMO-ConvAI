    "question": "Imagine you are navigating in the ALFRED Embodied Environment with a task to locate a magazine and place it on a side table. Given your actions: ['move to drawer', 'move to sofa', 'search under chair', 'search garbage can', 'place magazine on side table', 'check inventory', 'inspect magazine'], how would you complete this mission?",
    "steps": [],
    "answer": "You're currently moving through a room equipped with various furniture items.
