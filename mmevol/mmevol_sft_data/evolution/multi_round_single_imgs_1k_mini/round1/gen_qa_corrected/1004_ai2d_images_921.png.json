    ],
    "answer": "The mouse serves as an essential primary consumer in the ecosystem, feeding on plants and serving as prey for secondary consumers such as snakes and tertiary consumers like hawks. By regulating plant population and providing energy to predators, mice contribute to the stability and sustainability of the ecosystem. If mouse numbers fluctuate, it could cause knock-on effects throughout the food web, affecting the populations of both its predators and the plants it consumes."

      }
    ],
    "answer": "Oak and pine trees are fundamental producers in the forest ecosystem. They convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, forming the base of the food web. Their presence supports primary consumers like the mouse and insects, which then supply energy to higher trophic levels, including secondary consumers like the salamander and tertiary consumers like the hawk. Furthermore, trees contribute to the ecosystem's structure and habitat, supporting biodiversity and ecological interactions."
