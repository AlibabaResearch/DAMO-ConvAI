This is evidenced by various suitcases, including both an open and a closed one, and numerous backpacks scattered around the space. The placement of the chairs, such as those at coordinates [0.204, 0.147, 0.265, 0.460], [0.349, 0.203, 0.535, 0.485], and [0.568, 0.187, 0.715, 0.507], contributes to the disorder; they are not arranged for use but rather appear to be pushed aside to make room for packing activities. Therefore, the clutter suggests a temporary state of disarray caused by preparations for travel."
