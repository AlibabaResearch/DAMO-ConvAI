# MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct

This is the official data collection of the paper "MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct", the dataset and checkpoint will be released soon.

We are continuously refactoring our code, be patient and wait for the latest updates!

## ðŸ§ª Dataset Details

The Tongyi-ConvAI generates this dataset for multi-modal supervised fine-tuning. This dataset was used to train **Evol-Llama3-8B-Instruct** and **Evol-Qwen2-7B** reported in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05840).

To create this dataset, we first selected 163K Seed Instruction Tuning Dataset for Evol-Instruct, then we enhance data quality through an iterative process that involves a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution. This process results in the generation of a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset, which in turn empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities.

Below we showcase the detailed data distribution of the SEED-163K, which is prepared for multi-round evolution mentioned above:
