            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The Twelve Apostles are a series of towering limestone stacks along the coast of Victoria, Australia. Formed by erosion over millions of years, these formations are the remnants of ancient cliffs that have been worn down by harsh weather conditions and the relentless sea. Each stack is made up of layers of limestone, sedimentary rock that originated from the accumulation of marine organisms' skeletal remains. These formations not only represent stunning natural beauty but also offer rich insights into the region's geological history. The varying heights and shapes of the stacks provide a visual record of the ongoing natural forces shaping the coastline."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Absolutely! Did you know that despite the name, there were never exactly twelve stacks? The name 'Twelve Apostles' was attractively given to the site in the 1920s to draw tourists, but originally there were nine stacks. Over time, due to the erosive power of the ocean, some of these stacks have collapsed, and now only eight still stand tall. It's a testament to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of coastal geology."
