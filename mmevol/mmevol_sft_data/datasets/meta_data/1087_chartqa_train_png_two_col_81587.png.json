            "answer": "The bar chart shows fluctuations in consumer expenditure on recreational books in the US from 1999 to 2019. The initial decade displays a consistent increase, peaking in 2009.

            "answer": "The year 2009 posted the highest expenditure on recreational books, with consumers spending nearly $27.63 billion. This peak might indicate a strong economy or a particular interest in reading due to popular titles or trends during that year. It could also suggest that digital media hadn't yet fully displaced physical book sales."

Additionally, figures adjusted for inflation would offer more insights into real spending power changes over the years."
