            "question": "The map shows three bus stations at points $A, B$ and $C$. A tour from station $A$ to the Zoo and the Port and back to $A$ is $10 \\mathrm{~km}$ long. $A$ tour from station $B$ to the Park and the Zoo and back to B is $12 \\mathrm{~km}$ long. A tour from station C to the Port and the Park and back to $C$ is $13 \\mathrm{~km}$ long. Also, A tour from the Zoo to the Park and the Port and back to the Zoo is $15 \\mathrm{~km}$ long. How long is the shortest tour from A to B to $C$ and back to $A$?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To determine the shortest tour from A to B to C and back to A, we need to understand the defined distances between these tourist attractions and plan the most efficient path. The distances between Zoo, Park, and Port, which are the respective midpoints between A, B, and C, can be identified from the circumference of the tours provided. By analyzing these midpoints, determining the side lengths of each segment between the bus stations A, B, and C, and calculating the routes, the shortest path can be derived. Given the options, the shortest path in this context considering each side approximately equals the sum of segments and is nearly symmetrical would plausibly be the one from option '$20 \\mathrm{~km}$'."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The map's topology and the given distances embody concepts of graph theory and circuit theory, particularly related to finding the shortest path or cycle in a weighted graph. The locations A, B, and C can be treated as vertices, and the distances (or paths connecting the attractions) as weighted edges. Techniques from graph theory like Dijkstra's algorithm or the Minimum Spanning Tree could be applied here to deduce the shortest possible route that connects all these points cyclically."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "This diagram is a valuable educational tool for urban planning as it can help planners understand the importance of layout and connectivity in transportation networks. Properly assessing the shortest routes between key locations not only reduces travel time but also can significantly cut down on fuel consumption and traffic congestion. The principles demonstrated here are directly applicable in the planning of services like public transport routes, emergency services paths, and overall city connectivity."
