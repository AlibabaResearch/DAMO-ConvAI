            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To keep the kitchen organized and free of clutter, one should consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. Regularly clean and maintain the kitchen, which includes white floors, yellow cabinets, and countertops.\n2. Store less frequently used items, like the potted plant, vase, and other decorative items, in suitable spots to maximize counter space.\n3. Use separators or organizers inside cabinets and drawers to keep utensils and other kitchen tools tidy.\n4. Place necessary appliances, such as the oven, refrigerator, and microwave, in strategic positions for easy access while avoiding overcrowding.\n5. Keep the sink area clean and free of dishes by washing them promptly or using a dishwasher.\n6. Utilize vertical storage solutions like shelves, hooks, or magnetic strips to store pots, pans, and other kitchen equipment.\n7. Create designated areas for specific items - such as a fruit bowl for apples - to maintain a uniform look.\n8. Consider using a stool or chair for seating at the kitchen counter, which can be tucked away when not in use and reduce visual clutter.\n\nBy applying these strategies, the kitchen can remain organized, visually appealing, and comfortable to work in."

A white countertop extends across one side of the kitchen, providing ample workspace. A red stool, adding a pop of color, is tucked neatly under the countertop.\n\nOn the countertop, you can spot a white sink with a faucet, ready for dishwashing duties. Adjacent to it is a white stove featuring a black cooktop, where delicious meals are likely prepared. A white refrigerator stands tall next to the stove, presumably storing ingredients and leftovers. A white trash can is also present in the kitchen, ensuring cleanliness and order.\n\nThe countertop and top of the refrigerator serve as display areas for several plants and decorative items, adding a touch of nature and personal style to the space. The floor beneath is covered in white linoleum, maintaining the clean and bright aesthetic of the room.\n\nOne of the walls features a window that offers a picturesque view of a green backyard, inviting natural light into the kitchen and providing a pleasant contrast to the indoor setting. The window not only illuminates the kitchen but also connects the indoor space with the outdoor world."
