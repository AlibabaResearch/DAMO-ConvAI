            "question": "What factors might affect the longevity of the bananas on display?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The longevity of the bananas on display may be influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to direct sunlight. In the image, there are numerous bunches of yellow bananas displayed on a checkered cloth. As bananas are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, it is essential to maintain an optimal temperature to ensure they do not overripe or spoil quickly. Similarly, humidity levels can affect the freshness and appearance of the bananas. High humidity can lead to rapid overripening and decay, while low humidity can cause the bananas to dehydrate and lose their vibrant appearance. Exposure to direct sunlight can also accelerate the ripening process, causing the bananas to spoil faster. Therefore, store owners should consider these environmental factors to assure the longevity and quality of the bananas on display. Proper storage methods, such as avoiding overcrowding, ensuring good air circulation, and keeping them away from direct sunlight or heat sources, can help maintain the bananas in good condition for an extended period."
