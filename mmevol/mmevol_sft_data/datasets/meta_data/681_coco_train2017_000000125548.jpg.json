The elephant, with its gray skin, faces towards the left side of the photo. Its grandeur is further accentuated by the low angle from which the photo is taken, making it appear as if it's towering over the viewer.\n\nPerched on the back of this elephant is a woman, her colorful outfit contrasting beautifully against the elephant's gray hue. She is smiling, her joy evident as she poses for the photo, adding a touch of liveliness to the scene.\n\nThe courtyard itself is a sight to behold. Palm trees dot the area, their lush green leaves swaying gently in the breeze. The walls of the courtyard are made of red brick, their rustic charm complementing the overall aesthetic of the scene. The combination of nature and artistry creates a serene atmosphere that invites exploration and admiration."
