Use lights and reflectors on bicycles, especially during low-light conditions or nighttime riding, to increase visibility to other road users.\n4. Maintain a safe distance from vehicles and other cyclists, avoiding abrupt maneuvers or weaving between traffic lanes.\n5. Stay in designated bike lanes or paths when available, and otherwise, ride on the right side of the road, in the same direction as traffic.\n6. Perform regular maintenance of the bicycles to ensure proper functioning of all components, such as brakes, gears, and tires.\n7. Communicate with each other through hand signals or verbal cues to keep the group informed about potential hazards or the need to stop or change direction.\n\nBy following these safety measures, the group can reduce risks and create a more secure environment for themselves and other road users."
