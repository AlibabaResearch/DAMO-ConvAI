Inside, you discover a treasure trove of legendary kitchen tools: a chef's knife that never dulls, a ladle that always serves the perfect amount, and a magical cookbook filled with recipes that grant extraordinary culinary powers. The final treasure, however, is a golden mug that cools any liquid to the perfect drinking temperature, the very object you need for your task."
