A gold rope barrier surrounds the statue, setting it apart from the rest of the lobby.\n\nIn the background, the hustle and bustle of the hotel can be seen. People are walking by with their luggage, perhaps checking in or out of the hotel. A sign that reads \"Lobby Bar\" is also visible, indicating a place where guests can relax and enjoy a drink.\n\nThe colors in the image are predominantly brown and gold, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, the black and white stripes of the zebra provide a striking contrast, drawing attention to the statue. The precise location of each object and their relative positions contribute to a well-composed image that tells a story about this unique hotel lobby."
