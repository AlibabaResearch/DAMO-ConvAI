            "answer": "In a world where wrestlers moonlight as superheroes, each one sports a unique power.

Shadowstep can teleport short distances, perfect for surprise attacks, while Ironclad's unbreakable skin makes him nearly invincible. The massive figure on the left, 'Gigaton', wields earth-shaking strength, his presence a looming threat. They gather in the ring, not just for sport but to train for the ultimate showdown against the forces of evil threatening their city."

Additionally, their 'public' rivalry can mask covert exchanges of vital information, ensuring their real identities remain hidden while simultaneously forging bonds of trust and camaraderie essential for their secret missions."

They often use visualization techniques to mentally rehearse moves and anticipate their opponent's actions. Building a strong in-ring persona requires psychological readiness to stay in character and engage the audience effectively. Pre-match rituals, such as listening to music or meditation, help in calming nerves and channeling energy. Wrestlers must also develop mental resilience to handle the physical pain and pressure, staying calm and composed under intense conditions. A strong support system, including coaches and peers, provides emotional stability and motivation."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To safely execute high-risk moves, wrestlers undergo extensive training to perfect their techniques and ensure precise execution. They learn to distribute impacts safely, using muscles and soft areas to absorb shock instead of joints and bones. Communication with opponents is imperative, ensuring both parties are aware and prepared for the maneuver. Utilizing protective gear and a well-padded ring surface minimizes injury risks. Regular rehearsals, including stunt coordination with experienced trainers, help in mastering these moves while maintaining the theatrical aspect of wrestling. Adherence to safety protocols and continuous skill development are essential for minimizing injuries and enhancing performance."
