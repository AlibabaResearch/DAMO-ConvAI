            "steps": [],
            "answer": "This concept is rooted in the definitions: 'independent' meaning self-ruling, 'city' meaning a large town, and 'state' meaning a territory with its own government. Combining these, an independent city-state is a self-ruling city with its own government. Historically, such cities were called 'polis' in ancient Greece. Today, the term 'polis' appears in city names like Minneapolis in Minnesota and Annapolis in Maryland, reflecting their heritage."

            "question": "What role does self-governance play in the everyday lives of residents in an independent city-state?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Self-governance allows residents of an independent city-state to have direct influence over local policies, laws, and taxation. This often results in governance that is more responsive to the specific needs and desires of the populace. Educational systems, public services, and community projects are designed and managed locally, often leading to a stronger, more engaged society. However, this also requires a high level of civic participation and responsibility from the residents."
