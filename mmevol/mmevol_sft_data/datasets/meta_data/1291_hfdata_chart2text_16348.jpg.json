Analyzing these trends helps stakeholders make informed decisions about investments, marketing strategies, and product development."

It's also possible that a groundbreaking technology or feature was introduced, captivating a vast audience and significantly boosting sales."

This could attract players with exclusive skins, missions, and bonuses, driving a temporary spike in revenue through increased in-game spending."
