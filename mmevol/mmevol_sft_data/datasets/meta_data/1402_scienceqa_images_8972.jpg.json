            "answer": "Ellen and Lamar's experiment can best answer the question: 'Does applying wax to a snowboard reduce its sliding time down a snowy hill?' This question investigates the effects of wax on a snowboard's performance, measuring the time it takes for the snowboard to descend slopes with and without wax. This specific answer focuses on understanding the variables manipulated in their experiment and the direct outcomes measured."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Snowboarding in heavy snow, as depicted, offers several advantages, including softer landings, which reduce the risk of injury during falls. The deep snow can also create a unique and exhilarating experience as it adds an extra challenge to maneuverability and control, enhancing the skillset of the snowboarder."

            "question": "How does the type of snow affect the speed and control of a snowboard?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The type of snow significantly affects both the speed and control of a snowboard. Fresh, powdery snow might slow down the board due to increased resistance, offering a higher degree of control. In contrast, icy or compact snow provides less resistance, enabling higher speeds but often with decreased control, which can increase the difficulty of maneuvering and maintaining stability."
