            "answer": "In the diagram, the lowest in the food chain are the producers, specifically the group including flower, grass, or water plant. These provide the fundamental energy source for all other organisms higher up in the chain."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "In the food chain present in the diagram, the brown bear is categorized as a secondary consumer. This classification means that it primarily feeds on primary consumers like the salmon and deer, thereby occupying a vital role in controlling these populations and aiding in energy transfer within the ecosystem."

            "question": "How is energy transferred in this food chain from one level to the next?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Energy transfer in this food chain begins at the producer level with plants like flowers, grass, or water plants, which capture solar energy and convert it into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Primary consumers, such as the moose and salmon, eat these plants and absorb their energy. Secondary consumers, like the brown bear, then consume these primary consumers, transferring the stored energy further up the chain."
