            "answer": "The Rock Cycle illustrates how rocks continually change form. There are three basic types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic, and each of these rocks can be changed into any one of the other types. The names of the rock types refer to the way the rocks are formed. Arrows in the diagram display how one type of rock may change to another type of rock. All igneous rocks start out as melted rock(magma) and then crystallize, or freeze. When an igneous rock is exposed on the surface, it goes through the process of weathering and erosion that breaks the rock down into smaller pieces. Wind and water carry the smaller pieces of igneous rock into piles called sediment. Through the process of compaction and cementation, the sediment gets buried and the pieces of rock become cemented together to form a new type of rock called a sedimentary rock. If a sedimentary rock is exposed at the surface, it can be eroded away and eventually changed into a new sedimentary rock. However, if a sedimentary(or an igneous) rock gets buried deep in the Earth, heat and pressure will cause profound physical and/or chemical change. This process is called metamorphosis, and the new rock is called a metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rock can also be weathered and eroded and eventually changed into a sedimentary rock. Or, if a metamorphic rock is forced deeper into the Earth, the rock can melt and become magma. Igneous rock and sedimentary rock can also be forced deep into the Earth and melt into magma. Once magma cools, it forms igneous rocks again."
