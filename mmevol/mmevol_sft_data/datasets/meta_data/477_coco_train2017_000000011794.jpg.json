            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The skateboarder in the image faces several challenges while performing his air trick on the ramp. First, they must master the necessary skills and techniques essential for such a maneuver, such as balance, speed control, and precise timing. Second, the skateboarder needs to overcome the fear of potentially getting injured if things go wrong, as aerial tricks typically involve higher risks due to increased height and the risk of falls. Additionally, the skateboarder must maintain perfect body alignment and grip on the skateboard while he soars through the air to ensure a successful landing and avoid any accidents. Finally, the skateboarder needs to stay aware of his surroundings, ensuring that no other people or obstacles are near him during the trick to avoid any collisions or interruptions."
