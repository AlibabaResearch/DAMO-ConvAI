Behind a sturdy blue fence, the elephant stands tall and calm, its long trunk reaching out to interact with three visitors who are clearly delighted by the encounter.\n\nOne of the individuals, dressed in casual attire, extends their hand to feed the elephant, an action that seems to be appreciated by the gentle giant. The other two people are engrossed in petting the elephant's trunk, their faces filled with awe and admiration for the magnificent creature.\n\nThe backdrop to this touching interaction is a lush array of trees that provide a stark contrast to the city skyline visible in the distance. Despite being in an urban setting, the atmosphere is one of harmony between humans and nature."
