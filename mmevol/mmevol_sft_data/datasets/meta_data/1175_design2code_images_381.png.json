            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To begin building a website with HTML from the ground up, start by setting up a basic HTML template. Start with a 'doctype' declaration, then create the html tag, which contains the head and body. Inside the head, add a title and any necessary metadata. In the body section, you'll start with your content using tags like h1 for headers, p for paragraphs, and a for links. Add a link to your CSS stylesheet within the head to style the page. Here's an example of a simple HTML skeleton:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Your Website Title Here</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>\n  <p>This is a paragraph with some introductory text about the site.</p>\n  <!-- Add more content here -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```"

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Based on the image, improvements to the visual design could include increasing hierarchy and contrast to make important elements stand out more. For example, call-to-action buttons like 'Download' or 'Learn More' should be more prominent. In addition, incorporating more visual elements such as icons or illustrations could make the interface more engaging. Finally, ensuring the images of screenshots are high quality and informative would also enhance the site's credibility and user interest."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To enhance credibility, the website could include testimonials from satisfied users, showcasing how the signal booster has improved their phone's connectivity. These could be paired with before-and-after signal strength statistics. Additionally, including trusted badges or certifications and mentions in reputable media or tech reviews could serve as powerful social proof that legitimizes the product and the website."
