            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The stage labeled 'I' in the diagram represents the 'Fry' stage of the wild Atlantic salmon's life cycle. At this point, the young salmon have emerged from their eggs, developed into free-swimming fish, and are characterized by their vertical stripes or parr marks. This is a critical growth phase before they transform into 'Parr.'"

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Certainly! During the 'Spawning in a Redd' stage, female Atlantic salmon select a spot in a riverbed to lay their eggs. A 'Redd' is a gravel nest where the female deposits her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs with his milt, and the female covers them with gravel for protection. This process ensures the eggs' safety from predators and the current, allowing them to develop into 'Eyed eggs' where you can see the developing embryos inside."

            "question": "What are the defining characteristics of the 'Parr' stage in the salmon's life cycle?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The 'Parr' stage is one of the juvenile phases of Atlantic salmon life where the fish display prominent vertical bars known as parr marks along their sides. These marks provide camouflage against the riverbed. During this stage, the salmon are larger than during the 'Fry' stage and start to prepare for their eventual migration to the ocean by undergoing physiological changes, a process known as smoltification."

            "question": "And how do they adapt to moving from freshwater to seawater?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "As the 'Parr' transition into 'Smolt,' they undergo significant changes in their bodies to adapt from a freshwater to a seawater environment. This includes changes in their gills, kidneys, and scales to maintain the proper salt balance in their bodies, a shift in behavior to become more active at night, and changes in their body shape and coloration to better suit life in the ocean. These adaptations help prepare them for their challenging journey into the marine waters where they will grow to adulthood."
