            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The death of the key hole limpet would primarily affect the purple sea urchin and rock crabs, as shown in the ecological diagram. The limpet is closely connected to these species, suggesting their populations could be destabilized due to changes in algae populations and available nutrients, further impacting the broader marine ecosystem."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The key hole limpet plays a significant role in its ecosystem by regulating the growth of seaweeds and algae. Its feeding activity helps maintain the balance of these populations, which is crucial for the health and stability of other species like abalone and turban snails."

            "question": "What might happen to the algae populations if the key hole limpet disappears?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "If the key hole limpet were to disappear, we might see an overgrowth of algae and seaweeds, as the limpets help control these populations by feeding on them. This overgrowth can lead to imbalances in the marine ecosystem, affecting various species dependent on these plants for shelter and food."
