            "answer": "The diagram shows the molecular structure of Butane. Butane molecules have four carbon atoms and ten hydrogen atoms (C4 H10). Butane is classified as compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen molecules, called Hydrocarbons. Saturated Hydrocarbons are the simplest Hydrocarbons. They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible and single bonds between carbon atoms. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen. The diagram shows 3 carbon-carbon bonds and 10 carbon-hydrogen bonds. Their most important use is as fuels. Hydrocarbons are also used to manufacture many products, including plastics and synthetic fabrics such as polyester."
