This unusual decor might also leave a lasting impression on visitors, making the bathroom and the place overall memorable."

Additional details about the show's air time and channel are also provided on the poster, indicating that new episodes are available on Sundays at 10PM/9C on HBO.\n\nThe overall composition of the image suggests a blend of everyday life with the glamour and drama encapsulated by the TV show, creating an interesting juxtaposition between reality and fiction. The precise placement of the poster above the toilet also adds a touch of humor to the scene, subtly implying that even in the most private moments, one cannot escape the pervasive influence of popular culture."
