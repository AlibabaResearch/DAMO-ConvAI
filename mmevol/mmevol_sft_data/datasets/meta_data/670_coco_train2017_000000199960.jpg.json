            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Big Ben, officially named the Elizabeth Tower since 2012, is a prominent symbol of London and the United Kingdom. It has great historical significance and represents the nation's culture and heritage. Completed in 1859, the tower is part of the Houses of Parliament, also known as the Palace of Westminster, which houses the legislative bodies of the UK: the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\n\nThe clock tower has become a symbol of stability and continuity, as it has stood tall and kept time through various historical events, such as World War II. During the war, the clock tower remained in operation despite the bombings that damaged the surrounding buildings, including the Houses of Parliament, embodying the perseverance and resilience of Londoners and the British people as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, the clock's chimes, which have become famous worldwide, are often used as a key reference for marking time in various forms of media, including radio and television broadcasts. Westminster Bridge, the iconic structure located adjacent to the clock tower, offers a picturesque view of both Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, making it one of the most photographed and visited spots in London.\n\nIn summary, Big Ben, as a historical monument and a symbol of London's identity, has great significance not only for its local residents but also for people around the world. Its striking architecture, rich history, and iconic chimes have made Big Ben an enduring symbol of the United Kingdom's cultural heritage."

In the image, multiple cars, buses, and trucks can be seen on the streets, and many pedestrians are walking near the vehicles. This highlights the importance of effective traffic management strategies and maintaining a heightened awareness for both pedestrians and drivers in urban environments such as this to ensure safe navigation and minimize accidents. Also, tourists may cause additional obstacles on the sidewalks and roads as they tend to stop and take photos or admire the architecture, which could further disrupt the pedestrian and vehicle flow."
