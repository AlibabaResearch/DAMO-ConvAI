They might be displayed as pieces of art or as an expression of personal interest in skateboarding. Alternatively, the decks could be stored on the wall, using hooks or metal brackets, to save floor space or keep them organized when not in use. The wall-mounted skateboard setup also makes it easy for the owner to access the boards quickly and conveniently when needed. The presence of two decks in the image might suggest that the owner has a collection or is passionate about skateboarding."

The downtown area of the city is highlighted in a striking red color, creating a beautiful contrast with the rest of the map. \n\nJust below it, there's another skateboard deck with a unique design. This deck showcases a black and white marble pattern, giving it a sleek and modern look. The word \"Supreme\" is prominently displayed in gold, adding an element of luxury to the design.\n\nBoth decks are securely mounted on silver brackets, which not only serve a functional purpose but also add to the overall aesthetic of the display. The top deck is positioned slightly higher than the bottom one, creating a visually pleasing staggered effect.\n\nThe image captures the essence of urban culture and street style, represented through the medium of skateboard art."
