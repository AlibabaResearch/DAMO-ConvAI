            "answer": "This diagram represents the layers of the ocean. The oceans are divided into two broad realms; the pelagic and the benthic. Pelagic refers to the open water in which swimming and floating organisms live. Organisms living there are called the pelagos. From the shallowest to the deepest, biologists divide the pelagic into the epipelagic the mesopelagic the bathypelagic the abyssopelagic and the deepest, the hadopelagic. The last three zones have no sunlight at all. The Habitat zone is formed by 5 mini zones: Abbysal, Bathyal, Hadal, Neritic, and Oceanic. One-third of the Earth is made up of the Abbysal zone. It is very cold and dark in this zone. In the Bathyal zone, the food and temperature easily fall into the deepest zones of the ocean. The Hadal zone is the deepest zone in the ocean. It has high-pressure conditions and it's really cold. The Neritic zone is rich in plants, animals, and nutrients that are carried by currents of land. In the Oceanic zone, there is an abundant life of plankton."
