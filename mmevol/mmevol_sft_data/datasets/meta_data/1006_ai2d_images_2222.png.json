            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Young salamanders, or larvae, are often smaller with underdeveloped features, and they might possess gills for aquatic breathing. Adults are larger, have fully developed legs, and lose their larval gills if they undergo metamorphosis, adapting to life on land."

            "answer": "Salamanders have a carnivorous diet that adapts with age. Larvae typically feed on small waterborne organisms, like daphnia or brine shrimp, while adults eat larger prey such as insects, worms, and even smaller salamanders."
