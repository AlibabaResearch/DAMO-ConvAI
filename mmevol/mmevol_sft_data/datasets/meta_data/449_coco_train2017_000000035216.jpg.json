            "answer": "The use of smart technology like the handheld device that the person is holding has both positive and negative impacts on the individual. On the positive side, handheld devices like game pads, tablets, and game systems can provide entertainment, mental stimulation, and relaxation. They can also improve certain cognitive skills like problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and reflexes when used for gaming. Additionally, they can help people stay connected with friends and family or access a wealth of information.\n\nOn the negative side, the excessive use of such technology can lead to sedentary lifestyles, physical health issues like eyestrain and repetitive stress injuries, and even addiction to gaming or screen time. It might also impact their social skills and limit one's interaction with the real world, affecting their overall well-being.\n\nThe key lies in finding a balance in the use of technology and ensuring that it complements one's life without causing any negative impacts on their health or relationships."
