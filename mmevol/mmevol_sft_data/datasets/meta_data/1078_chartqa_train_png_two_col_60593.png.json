            "steps": [],
            "answer": "These changes could influence software developers to optimize their applications for desktop computers, ensuring superior performance and user experience on this form factor given its growth. They should not neglect mobile development due to its overall market dominance and slight increase. However, developers might deprioritize tablet-specific features or versions of their apps, unless there is a strategic niche market or use-case for tablets that they aim to target."
