As a creature deeply rooted in North American history, it would also symbolize the Rough Riders' place in the narrative of the American Century."

The Rough Riders were often called to recon missions or skirmishes with Spanish forces, demanding constant vigilance and readiness to ride into action at a moment's notice. Evenings might involve planning sessions, stories around campfires, and discussions on strategy while anticipating the next day's challenges. Despite the hardships, camaraderie and a shared sense of purpose helped solidify their bond and resolve."
