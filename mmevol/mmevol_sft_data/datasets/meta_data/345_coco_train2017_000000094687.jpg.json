            "steps": [],
            "answer": "There are several reasons for flight delays at airports, which can significantly impact passengers' travel plans. Some common causes of delays include:\n\n1. Weather: Adverse weather conditions such as snow, heavy rain, thunderstorms, or strong winds can create unsafe flying conditions, prompting delayed or canceled flights. In extreme cases, the entire airport may need to shut down temporarily.\n\n2. Air Traffic: High levels of air traffic can cause a backup in the takeoff and landing queues, resulting in delays. To maintain the safety and efficiency of air travel, air traffic controllers may need to temporarily ground flights or set specific takeoff times.\n\n3. Mechanical Issues: Aircraft need to be in good working order for safe operation. Unexpected mechanical problems may require maintenance checks or repairs, causing flights to be delayed or even canceled.\n\n4. Staff and Crew Issues: Airlines operate with strict staff schedules and crew rest requirements. Flight crews may face delays in arriving at their assigned flights, leading to subsequent delays for passengers. Labor-related disruptions such as strikes can also affect flight schedules.\n\n5. Security Concerns: From time to time, security threats or breaches can cause delays or even temporary suspensions of airport activities, as proper procedures and investigations are carried out to ensure passenger safety.\n\nWhen such delays happen, passengers may face varying levels of inconvenience. For instance, passengers may need to reschedule their travel plans or book accommodation for an extra night at their departure city. Delays can also lead to missed connections, impacting work or personal commitments, and causing additional stress for travelers. Airlines may provide compensation, alternate flight arrangements, or lodging, depending on the severity and reason for the delay. Overall, flight delays can be frustrating and challenging for passengers, affecting their overall travel experience."

Travelers may also get engaged in conversations with fellow passengers, read books or magazines, use their electronic devices to browse the internet, listen to music, or watch movies. Additionally, people can grab a snack from a nearby cafe or restaurant, shop at duty-free stores, or simply relax by taking a short walk around the airport terminal.
