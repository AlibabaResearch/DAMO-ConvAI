Their hat adds a splash of color to the scene.\n\nFinally, on the far left, a person in a black shirt is observing the person in the middle. Their black shirt provides a stark contrast to the lighter colors worn by others.\n\nThe store behind them has bottles visible in the window, suggesting it might be a beverage shop or grocery store. The red and white sign of the store serves as an interesting backdrop for this group of people."
