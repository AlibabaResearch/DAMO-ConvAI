            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To start building a website with HTML, begin by creating a fundamental HTML document structure with tags like <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>. Inside the <body>, add structural elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> to define sections. Use <h1> to <h6> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <a> for links, and <img> for images. After you have your HTML structure, you can style it with CSS and make it interactive with JavaScript."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Sure! The layout depicted in the image can be created using a combination of <div> elements for structure, alongside semantic HTML5 elements. You'll have a <header> for the top section, followed by <nav> for the navigation links. Use <main> for the central plugin directory detail, incorporating <article> for the post, and <aside> for the sidebar with the 'Popular Plugins'. Wrap the bottom content in a <footer>. Don\u2019t forget to use responsive design techniques such as media queries in your CSS to ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To add a 'Search by Keyword' section in HTML, start with a <section> or <div> container and give it a clear id or class name for styling. Inside, use a <form> element with a <label> for accessibility, and an <input> element of type 'text' for the search input. Add a <button> or <input> of type 'submit' for the search action. To display keywords, use an unordered list <ul> with <li> items, each containing an <a> tag for interactivity. You can group keywords with similar classes for styling and include a <span> to show the keyword count."

            "question": "What are some tips for ensuring the 'Popular Plugins' list is accessible and user-friendly in HTML?",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "For an accessible and user-friendly 'Popular Plugins' list, use semantic HTML by implementing an <aside> tag to define the section as related content. Inside, employ a <nav> element if the plugins are navigational links. Use meaningful <h4> headings for titles and an unordered <ul> for the list of items. Each plugin name should be enclosed in an <li> and linkable via <a> tags. Ensure proper contrast ratio for text and background for visibility and include `alt` text for any icons or images. Lastly, consider keyboard navigation by making sure that the list items can be tabbed through and selected using keyboard controls."
