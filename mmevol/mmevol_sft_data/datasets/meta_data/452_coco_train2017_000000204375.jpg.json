            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To ensure the wellbeing of the sheep and the donkey (or mule) in the grassy pasture, a farmer must consider several factors including nutrition, shelter, companionship, and healthcare. \n\n1. Nutrition: Both animals should have access to a sufficient amount of quality food, such as fresh grass or hay, and clean water to maintain their health. A farmer should also regularly monitor their nutritional needs and adjust their diet as needed.\n\n2. Shelter: Although the image shows animals outside in a grassy area, it is crucial that they have access to proper shelter, protecting them from harsh weather conditions or predators. A dry, clean, and well-ventilated shelter will help maintain the animals' health and wellbeing.\n\n3. Companionship: Since many farm animals, including sheep and donkeys, are social creatures, it is essential to ensure they have companionship. Keeping social animals together can help reduce stress and improve their overall wellbeing.\n\n4. Healthcare: Regular healthcare check-ups and vaccinations, as well as prompt treatment of any illnesses or injuries, ensure that the animals stay healthy. Farmers should also have a good understanding of the specific health requirements and potential issues related to each species.\n\nBy addressing these factors, a farmer can contribute to the wellbeing, happiness, and longevity of both the sheep and the donkey in the pasture."

The sheep is positioned behind a stone wall, which is made up of irregularly shaped rocks and is located in the foreground of the image. The donkey, on the other hand, is standing in front of this wall. It appears to be braying, with its mouth wide open and its tongue sticking out.\n\nThe field where these animals are situated is lush green, with yellow flowers scattered throughout. In the background, there's a tree without leaves under a cloudy sky. The overall scene creates a peaceful countryside atmosphere.
