            "question": "If the ABCDE shape is a rectangle where an equilateral triangle has been removed from one side of it, compute the perimeter of the ABCDE shape. Round computations to 2 decimal places.",
            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The given shape ABCDE is a rectangle with a width of 15 units and a length of 21 units. An equilateral triangle has been removed from one of the rectangle's sides, where the side length of the triangle is equal to 15 units. To compute the perimeter of the ABCDE shape, we first calculate the perimeter of the entire rectangle, which is 2 * (21 + 15) = 72 units. Since an equilateral triangle with a side length of 15 units is removed, we need to subtract the perimeter of the removed section. However, in addition to the sides of the triangle, we have the additional segments AD and ED to consider, where AD = AE + ED = 21 units. So to compute the new perimeter, we have to sum up all the remaining outside segments carefully by noting the original removed sections and added ones. In summary: Perimeter = (BA + AC) + (CB + BD (bottom and diagonal segments)) = 21+ 15+ 21 + 15 + 21 = 87 units."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "The shape ABCDE is essentially a rectangle from which an equilateral triangle has been removed. The rectangle's dimensions are 15 units in width and 21 units in length, measured clockwise from B to D. The equilateral triangle removed from side BD has each side equal to 15 units. A unique feature of this shape is the resulting pointed edge at point E, where two of the triangle's sides meet."

            "steps": [],
            "answer": "To calculate the perimeter of the modified ABCDE shape, you start from point A and trace the entire outside edge of the shape. The shape is formed by combining the straight segments of the rectangle and the sides of the equilateral triangle. Mathematically, you add the lengths of all the external edges. Since two sides of the triangle are present, and one side of the rectangle is removed while retaining the diagonal region joining AE and ED, you maintain the integrity in computing: \nPerimeter = AB + BC + CD + DE + AE. Considering side AB=BC=15, DE=EA = each 21 units long"

            "answer": "The initial rectangle ABCD inherently has right angles at each corner (90 degrees). The equilateral triangle removed from one side retains in equilibrium each angle measuring 60 degrees. When collectively seen, each angle of the combined shape returning point E makes interesting inferences for symmetry analysis, alongside angles at points A and D seamlessly form acute angles summing pointing sharp, diagonally intersecting vertically and horizontally advanced geometric visual presentation."

One potential application could be as a structural component in bridges or buildings, where the equilateral triangle cutout reduces material usage and weight while maintaining symmetrical balance in load distribution. The pointed edge at E could offer aesthetic appeals, functioning as a distinguishing architectural feature or constructive element whilst pragmatic."
