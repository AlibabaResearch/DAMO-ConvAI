            "steps": [],
            "answer": "Ground crews face several challenges while servicing commercial airplanes on the tarmac at airports. In the image, there are multiple airplanes of varying sizes, and each requires specific attention in terms of maintenance, fueling, baggage handling, catering, and cabin cleaning. The presence of different vehicles, such as trucks and buses, indicate the complex tasks to be carried out, often within tight timeframes to avoid flight delays.\n\nThese tasks demand coordination between multiple teams working in close proximity to each other, and in high-pressure environments. They need to ensure that all operations are performed with precision, efficiency, and safety. Additionally, ground crews have to work under varying weather conditions, which can sometimes be extreme, adding another layer of difficulty to their jobs. Overall, they must focus on providing a safe and comfortable experience for passengers while maintaining the schedule and operational efficiency of the airport."
